            <b>Madam Rolanda Hooch</b> was a witch who worked as the <b>Flying instructor, Quidditch refree</b>, and coach at <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. She learnt to fly on her own Sliver Arrow broomstick sometime before or during the Great War and returned to Hogwarts for a job. While on staff at Hogwarts, Hooch worked under <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Headmasters Albus Dumbledore</a>, <a href="Dolores_Umbridge.html">Dolores Umbridge</a>, and <a href="Minerva_McGonagall.html">Minerva McGonagall</a>.<br><br>
            
            During her years of employment at Hogwarts, she taught students how to successfully fly broomsticks (such as the famous <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a>), and also acted as the official referee for Quidditch games held at Hogwarts. Her profession also included other important duties, such as keeping students safe from harm whilst they trained for Quidditch, and checking the brooms of students to make sure they were not bewitched with dark charms.

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Rolanda Hooch was born prior to 1918. She learnt to fly on a <i>Silver Arrow broomstick</i> at some point. One night, during the Great War (1914-1918), her broom was singed by a Muggle anti-aircraft device, which she found personally insulting. She declared that the only thing she found more humilating than that incident was when a student jinxed her many decades later, in 1991. <br><br>
            
            She attended <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> in her youth, and was a member of her House Quidditch team. However, it is unknown which Hogwarts House she was sorted into. Sometime before her tenure at Hogwarts, Rolanda was selected by the <i>Department of Magical Games and Sports</i> as the Hogwarts Quidditch referee. After being selected she underwent a series of complicated and rigorous tests, both written and practical. She more then likely passed the tests as she eventually joined Hogwarts as the flying instructor for first year students.

        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Madam Hooch was known and respected by her students because of her belief in good sportsmanship, fairness, and clean games of Quidditch. She sometimes seemed impatient whilst teaching her students flying, as while teaching a group of first years, during the 1991-1992 school year she was continually telling them to "hurry up" and asking "well, what're you waiting for?".<br>
            
            Regardless she was still kind and caring, as evident when <a href="Neville_Longbottom.html">Neville Longbottom</a> broke his wrist after injuring himself during a Flying Class, she tended to him after his accident and took him immediately to the Hospital Wing. Another example was when she learnt that <a href="Ginny_Weasley.html">Ginerva Weasley</a> had been taken into the Chamber of Secrets. After learning this she had sunk (weak-kneed) into a chair in the staffroom. Hooch was also very strict and was unafraid to use an Impediment Jinx on Harry Potter and George Weasley after the two attacked <a href="Draco_Malfoy.html">Draco Malfoy</a>.
