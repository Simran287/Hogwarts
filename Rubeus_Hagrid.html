            <b>Professor Rubeus Hagrid</b> was an English <i>half-giant wizard</i>, son of Mr Hagrid and the giantess <i>Fridwulfa</i>, and elder half-brother of the giant <i>Grawp</i>.<br>
            
            Hagrid attended <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> in 1940 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. In Hagrid's third year, he was framed by <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Tom Riddle</a> for the crime of opening the Chamber of Secrets and using his pet Acromantula to attack several Muggle-born students and eventually killing one of them. Through Hagrid's wand was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of Hogwarts and allowed to live on the school grounds at the request of Albus Dumbledore.<br>
            
            In 1991, Hagrid was given the task of reintroducing <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a> to the wizarding world. In 1993, Hagrid would assume the post of Care of Magical Creatures professor after the retirement of <i>Professor Silvanus Kettleburn</i>. As a member of both the original and the re-instated Order of the Pheonix, Hagrid fought in several battles of the First and Second Wizarding Wars, including the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. By 2017, he was still living, and presumably still teaching and tending to his gamekeeping duties at Hogwarts, inviting Harry's son <i>Albus Severus</i> for tea when he joined the school as Harry informed him at the station, just as Hagrid had done to his father, <a href="Ron_Weasley.html">Ron Weasley</a> and <a href="Hermione_Granger.html">Hermione Granger</a>.<br><br>

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Hagrid was born on 6 December 1928 to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and Fridwulfa, a giantess, and grew up in the West Country of England, where he acquired his distinctive accent.<br>
            
            When Hagrid was about three, his mother returned to her <i>Giant colony</i>, leaving his father to raise him alone. Hagrid said he had very few memories of his mother from his childhood, but remembered his father fondly; as a half-giant, he overtook his father in size by the age of six, and amused the "tiny" wizard by picking him up and setting him on top of a dresser when Hagrid was annoyed by him. Later, when talking to Harry, Ron, and Hermione abouth the death of his mother, Hagrid admitted that she was not a great mother at all. He grew to an height of eleven and a half feet tall, immense by human standards but very small by giant standards.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Hagrid was an incredibly warm, kind-hearted man, and would often forget his exceptional size and strength when patting people on the back. Another of Hagrid's greatest traits was his courage. He was also very loyal to his friends and was ready to defend them or fight from them if necessary. He was particularly loyal to <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Albus Dumbledore</a>, describing him as a <i>"great man"</i>. He would react with fury if anyone dared insult the headmaster and wouldn't hesitate to magically assault or rough up the offender. However, despite his loyalty, Hagrid was not good at keeping secrets and accidentally told <i>Quirinus Quirrell, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger</i>, the secret of how to get past his three headed dog, <i>Fluffy</i>, which all four of them used to get through to the Philosopher's Stone. <br><br>
            
            Hagrid had a great love of magical creatures, including cross-breeds such as the Blast-Ended Skrewt, and had a better relationship with most of the inhabitants of the Forbidden Forest than most people, including the centaurs, through he had little interest in tame magical creatures due to the lack of a challenge they offered. Despite this, he did show a good understanding of such creatures. Unfortunately he tended to overlook the dangers behind certain magical creatures, such as his dragon <i>Norbert</i>, and his pet Acromantula <i>Aragog</i>, which was alleged by Tom Riddle to be the monster of <a href="Slytherin.html">Slytherin</a> in 1943, resulting in Hagrid's explusion from the school. Hagrid was fond of creatures in general and seemed to want to own any creature was even slightly fierce - his desires included a warthog and any dragon that he could get his hands on. <br><br>
            
            Harid had a fondness for drinks and was sometimes known to be agressive, especially when people insulted or dishonourably attacked those he cared about. Despite this, Hagrid was a very sensitive person and was known to burst into tears when someone close to him was harmed or killed, or when he felt responsible for something that put his friends in peril.<br><br>
            
            He also enjoyed cooking for his friends. However, his tendency to mostly cook foods suitable for himself and a lack of understaning of what his friends preferred eating meant that his cooking was usually turned down politely.

                <b>Family</b><br>
                Rubeus Hagrid was born to <i>Mr Hagrid</i>, a wizard, and the giantess <i>Fridwulfa</i>. Fridwulfa left the family because her son was "too small" for her liking, through Hagrid never seemed to resent her for abandoning him, generally appearing relatively indifferent about his lack of relationship with her. His father, on the other hand, seemed to be a very caring man who was heartbroken when his wife left, and was amused by the fact that, at the age of six, Hagrid was large enough to be able to set him on top of a dresser.<br>
                
                During his travels to the Northern giants colonies that same year, Hagrid found his maternal half-brother: an undersized giant called <i>Grawp</i>. As Grawp's size made it difficult for him to function within his colony, Hagrid brought him back to <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts</a> and hid him within the <i>Forbidden Forest</i>.

                <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
                <b>Pets and other creatures</b><br>
                Hagrid had a good relationship with most of his pets and other magical creatures, most notably <i>Fang, Aragog, and Buckbeak</i>. His relationship with most magical creatures was arguably better then the ones most other wizards had.<br>
                
                Hagrid also had a cordial relationship with the <i>Forbidden Forest Centaur colony</i>, especially with <i>Bane, Ronan, Magorian and Firenze</i>, and sometimes visited them whenever he went inside the Forest. However, Hagrid had a falling out with the centaurs when he defended Firenze from them as they believed Firenze had betrayed them by accepting the teaching post of Divination at Hogwarts, which was further complicated when he brought Grawp into the Forbidden Forest.<br>

            <li>
                <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
                <b>Albus Dumbledore</b><br>
                Albus Dumbledore placed great trust in Hagrid, which Hagrid returned with fierce loyalty and unwavering admiration. This loyalty always flared up whenever someone insulted Dumbledore, one time causing Hagrid to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail, and causing him to choke <i>Igor Karkaroff</i> another time.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
                <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
                Harry Potter and Hagrid shared a special relationship. Hagrid was one of the first people (if not the first) Harry could remember showing him genuine kindness and appearing to truly care for him. Hagrid was Harry's first true friend, and two helped each other get through many difficult situations and constantly looked out for one another.
