            <b>Professor Minerva McGonagall</b>, was a Scottish half-blood witch, the only daughter of <i>Muggle Robert McGonagall</i> and witch <i>Isobel Ross</i>. Minerva attended <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> and was sorted into <a href="Gryffindor.html">Gryffindor House</a>, but it took the Sorting Hat five and a half minutes to decide if she was Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, which made her a <i>Hatstall</i>. During her seventh year, she was appointed <i>Head Girl</i>.<br><br>
            
            After her education, Minerva worked for two years at the <i>Ministry of Magic</i> and later returned to Hogwarts, where she became <i>Head of Gryffindor House</i> and the <i>Transfiguration Professor</i>. Though she wasn't a member of the <i>Order of the Pheonix</i> during the First Wizarding War, Minerva greatly helped the Ministry of Magic's resistance through spying on Death Eaters and bringing the Aurors crucial information on their activities.<br><br>
            
            Minerva survived the Second Wizarding War and continued her job as Headmistress, a title she held as of Albus Potter's time at Hogwarts.

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Minerva McGonagall was born on 4th October and was named after her mother's grandmother, a very powerful witch. Her birth proved to be a joy and crisis: Isobel had given up the use of her magic for her love for Robert and never told him about her nature as she was afraid to mar the bliss of their wedding. However, the infant Minerva displayed small but noticeble signs of magic fromher earliest hours. She had no control of her magic, thus Isobel often secluded herself and Minerva for days at a time. She knew she must confess to her husbankd about their daughter's wizarding abilities and so she finally did, explaining everything to Robert and telling him that they were bound by the International Statute of Secrecy and they must conceal the truth about their magical abilities for their safety. The two parents remained together despite the shocking revalation, but their trust never was the same, much to the sadness of their perceptive daughter.<br><br>
            
            Minerva was very close to her Miggle father, whom in temperament she resembled more than her mother. When she received her admittance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she was free to be with her kind and to exercise her talents, Minerva saw how her mother sobbed that day, not only out of pride, but also out of envy.<br><br>
            
            During her Sorting, Minerva proved to be a hatstall: the Sorting Hat spent five-and-a-half minutes wavering between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw before deciding to place her in the former. Minerva was quickly recognised as the most outstanding student of her year with a particular talent for <i>Trandfiguration</i>. By the end of her education at Hogwarts, she had achieved an impressive record: <i>top grades in O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s, Prefect, Head Girl</i>, and winner of the <i>Transfiguration Today Most Promising Newcomer Award</i>. <br><br>
            
            After graduating from Hogwarts, Minerva was offered a position at the <i>Department of Magical Law Enforcement</i> of the British Ministry of Magic. Minerva fell head-over-heels in love with Dougal McGregor, a loccal Muggle, who was the handsome, clever, and funny son of a farmer. The two shared a sense of humour, argued firecely, and suspected mysterious depths in each other. Eventually, McGregor proposed to Minerva on a ploughed field and she accepted his offer. Thinking about her future, she realised that wedding a Muggle who didn't know that she was a witch would mean Minerva would follow her mother's footsteps and live unhappily with her wand locked away, shredding all of her ambitions. She broke off her engagement and left for London.<br><br>
            
            After two years in the Ministry, she was offered a prestigious promotion, yet found herself turning it down as she missed her home in Scotland. Instead, Minerva sent an owl to <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, asking whether she might be considered for a teaching post. The owl returned within hours, offering her a job in the Transfiguration Department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Minerva almost constantly exuded magnanimity and sternness, being held in great respect (and some fear) by nearly all students and staff. Used to having her way, she tolerated neither audacity nor silliness from her pupils and was known to turn cold towards people who said or did things in front of her that were stupid, or if she thought they were trying to be funny. She was woman who rarely smiled or gave compliments freely. Despite her stern demeanour, Minerva did exhibit a dry sense of humour which usually came out when times were tough. She wasn't afraid to speak her minf and showed quite a sharp tongue, especially during arguments.<br><br>
            
            True to Gryffindor, Minerva valued bravery and courage highly, believing cowardice be a heavy flaw. She fought with Death Eaters and protected her students, proving her bravery. Despite her loyalty to her house, Minerva was a fair-minded person who was known for docking points from students in her own House when she saw it must be done. Although she permitted of-age students to choose whether they wanted to stay or evacuate for the Battle of Hogwarts as a respect for their valour and rights, she gave the strict orders for anyone underage to evacuate, prioritising their safety over their courage and refusing to let under-qualified children risk dying in battle despite their desires.<br><br>
            
            For the most part, though, Minerva usually maintained great emotional composure, without being indifferent. Although she wasn't always particularly personable, she could be very warm and supportive during times of trouble or loss and cared a great deal about her students, both personally and academically. She was known to be extremely caring at times of tragedy, being known for her kindness in her own reserved manner. Though it rarely happened, Minerva showed a temper that can reveal itself on occasions when she was angry or flustered. Apparently, she shared this temper with her father. Upon seeing Harry's alleged death, Minerva screamed in such despair that Harry never heard before.<br><br>
            
            As the devoted instructor of <i>Transfiguration classes</i>, Minerva highly respected this specific branch of magic, which she considered be among the most difficult and sophisticated magic that Hogwarts students learn. She become an Animagus - complicated, long process - to futher her study in this subject and enjoyed correcting articles in <i>Transfiguration Today</i>. On the other hand, Minerva had very little patience with Divination, due to its impreciseness and rarity of true Seers.<br><br>
            
            Minerva inherited her cast-iron moral sense from her father. As a law-abiding citizen, she respected the particular law that all Animagi of Britain must register, insisting that <i>Talbott Winger</i> do so despite understanding his reason of secrecy. She wasn't inducted into the Order of the Phoenix during Voldemort's first climb to power because the Order was held as a renegade outfit by the Ministry, who feared Dumbledore's charisma and magical talent and were inclined to harbour fears that he wished to suceed them. Instead, she became their informant and bravely spied on Voldemort's followers in guise of a cat.<br><br>
            
            However, by the time of the second wizarding war, Minerva was no longer prepared to act as a spy for a Ministry she believed had become corrupt and dangerous. She is known to have a very severe dislike and hatred of those who abuse power, such as her making an enemy of <i>Dolores Umbridge</i> for the latter's bigoted and sociopathic behaviour. This also displayed her own distaste for racial prejudice and sadism. Following the confrontation with the Death Eaters who had invaded Hogwarts at the time of Albus Dumbledore's death, Minerva became a fully fledged member of the Order of the Pheonix, which was now, more than ever, seen as an outlaw organisation. Similarly she stood up to Amycus Carrow, despite the Death Eater's higher authority at the time, refusing to let him blame the students for Alecto's blunder and looked down at him with pure disgust.

                <b>Albus Dumbledore</b><br>
                Minerva knew Albus Dumbledore for the majority of her life. She attended Hogwarts as a student during Dumbledore's time as Transfiguration Professor and even replaced him as Head of Transfiguration when he took the position of Headmaster of the school. Albus discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late one evening after she founf out about <i>Dougal McGregor</i>'s marriage with another woman. She confessed the whole story to him, and he offered both comfort and wisdom; telling her some of his own family history, previously unknown to her.<br>
                
                The confidences exchanged between the two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship. Despite this fact, she had never been fully in his or Dumbledorr's confidence. Minerva was one of only a handful of people who knew how dreadful a moment it was for Dumbledore when he made the decision to confront and defeat the Dark Wizard <i>Gellert Grindelwald</i> in 1945.<br>
                
                Minerva never hesitated in displaying her loyalty to Dumbledore. When <i>Cornelius Fudge</i> brought Aurors to arrest Dumbledore in 1996. she boldly stepped forward and announced her intention to fight the Aurors on his behalf. She only stepped back at Dumbledore's insistence when he reminded her that Hogwarts and her students would need her in her absence. Minerva devasted when Dumbledore was killed in 1997 during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and arranged his funeral. A year later, when Harry was on a mission given to him by Dumbledore, she didn't question the decision of the late headmaster, but immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could.<br>

                <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
                Minerva showed her care for Harry ever since she, Dumbledore and Hagrid left him in the care of the Dursleys, in part because she had been quite fond of Harry's late parents. She was sort of a loving grandmother to him and expressed concern with both Dumbledore's choice trusting Hagrid to safely transport Harry to Little Whinging, and of the choice of family with whom Harry would stay. She spent hours on end spying on the Dursleys to get an insight to what life for Harry growing up would be like, calling them "the worst sort of Muggles imaginable". It is unlikely, however, that she kept watch over Harry, as she would never go against Dumbledore's actions, no matter how much she disagreed with them.<br>
                
                The two continued to have a very positive relationship over the following years. Harry acted as a frequent guest lecturer on Defense Against The Dark Arts, under Minerva's jurisdiction. She would serve as Headmistress over Harry's three children, and in turn she learned to expect them to get into the same kinds of trouble as their father. This was to be expected, after having now taught and served over three generations of Potters. Minerva's relationship with Harry experienced a brief strain when he blackmailed her into using the Marauder's Map to ensure Albus and Scorpius remains apart, which she felt great discontent at doing, but it was reconciled when Harry apologised and she wasn't shown to hold any ill-will afterwards.<br>
