        <h1 id="page_heading">Slytherin</h1>
        <img src="/images/Slytherin_Crest.png" id="house_crest" title="Slytherin Crest" alt="Slytherin Crest">
        <p class="text">
            <b>Slytherin</b> is one of the four Houses at <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts Schoolof Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, founded by <i>Salazar Slytherin</i>. In establishing the house Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick student who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics include cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition. Many Slytherin students tend to clique together, often aquiring leaders, which further exemplifies Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these include <a href="Draco_Malfoy.html">Draco Malfoy</a>'s Gang and the Death Eaters.<br><br>
            
            The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it can be a factor when being sorted. Students of any blood status can now be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-Born student from that house is considered to be quite rare.<br><br>
            
            The emblematic animal of the house is a snake and its colours are green and silver. There are two notable heads of the house; <i>Horace Slughorn</i> took the role twice (first leaving in 1981 and then taking the role again from 1997 until leaving before 2016), and <a href="Severus_Snape.html">Severus Snape</a>.<br><br>
            
            Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of <i>water</i> due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. Similarly, in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood only community. The colours also correspond with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often with grey rainwater.

        <h3 class="heading">Backstory</h3>
        <p class="text">
            This created great controversy at Hogwarts and it was the root of a feud between former friends Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor. Slytherin would later decide to leave the school when an argument started between him and Gryffindor and they either duelled or started started a civil war between the two houses. Such an argument would be forever known the origin of the feud between their two houses and also make them as the houses that are most competitive.<br><br>
            
            When Slytherin departed Hogwarts, he would leave behind the <i>Chamber of Secrets</i> with the purpose of an heir one day opening the chaber and unleashing a means of purging the school of those who, in his view, were unworthy to study magic: Muggle-borns. The chamber was opened twice and the monster was killed the second time by <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a> in 1992. Slytherin's views at the time could be attributed to the persecution of witches and wizards at the hand of Muggles during that century.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">Traits</h3>
        <img src="/images/Salazar_Slytherin.png" alt="Salazar Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin, Founder" class="img" style="float: left;">
        <p class="text">
            Slytherins tend to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also have highly developed senses of self-preservation. This means that Slytherins tend to hesistate before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.<br><br>
            
            According to <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Albus Dumbledore</a>, the qualities which Salazar valued in the students he had chosen included cleverness, resourcefulness, determination, and a <i>"a certain disregard for the rules"</i>. Dumbledore noted that all these were qualities possessed by Harry Potter, who was in Gryffindor but almost placed in Slytherin.<br><br>
            
            Slytherins tend to take charge and possess strong leadership skills. They are often self-assured and confident of their own competence and can be very loyal.<br><br>
            
            Another characteristic some Slytherins share is a tendency towards deep, unrequited love. <i>Severus Snape</i> and <i>The Bloody Baron</i> held abiding but unreturned feelings for <i>Lily Evans</i> and <i>Helena Ravenclaw</i>, repectively. ALthough some Slytherins, such as <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Tom Riddle</a>, were incapable of feeling love at all, those that did were known to cherish their passion abidingly and unconditionally, although often tragically due to an inability to act appropriately on their feelings. Interestingly, <i>Bellatrix Lestrange</i> had feelings for Tom Riddle himself, which was a factor in her fanatical devotion to the Death Eaters; although Lord Voldemort was incapable of loving her in return, the existences of <i>Delphini</i> suggests that there was atleast some kind of intimacy between them. Although <i>Merope Riddle</i> likely never attended Hogwarts and therefore wouldn't have been sorted into Slytherin at all, she was a descendent of Slytherin himself and fit the pattern of those sorted into his house, as she held deep and unreturned feelings for Tom Riddle Snr, who often travelled by her house on his carriage.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h5 class="sub_heading">Bloody purity</h5>
        <p class="text">
            The Sorting Hat claims that blood purity was a factor in selecting Slytherins. It is not the main factor but it suggests that the Sorting Hat takes into account the lineage of the student as well as traits. Muggle-born Slytherins exist, but are very rare, as noted insultingly by <i>Scabior the Snatcher</i>.<br><br>
            
            There have also been definite example of half-bloods sorted into the house, including Tom Riddle, Dolores Umbridge, and Severus Snape. Harry Potter was nearly sorted into Slytherin, but beacuse he asked not to be placed in Gryffindor instead. Also, pure-bloods are not automatically placed in Slytherin. There have been various examples of pure-bloods sorted into other houses; the <i>Weasley family, Sirius Black, Neville Longbottom, and James Potter</i> were all sorted into Gryffindor house, <i>Ernie Macmillan</i> was sorted into Hufflepuff.<br><br>
            
            The concept of blood purity playing a part in picking students for Slytherin house stems from the founder <i>Salazar Slytherin</i>, who wanted a stricter policy of admission to the school - one limited strictly to pure-blood students. This was contrary to the wishes of the other founders at <i>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</i>, who wanted to accept students of any blood status.<br><br>
            
            It is important to note that not every student in Slytherin agrees with the idea of blood purity, but every member would still be affiliated with their founder's reputed views a thousand years later. Since the house would nearly always select students who share his views during their time at Hogwarts. For example, in December 1992, the password for the common room was <i>"pure-blood"</i>.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub_heading">Rivalries</h5>
        <p class="text">
            Slytherin and Gryffindor are generally rivals in Quidditch and for the House Cup, of which the former had won seven years in a row prior to Harry Potter's arrival at Hogwarts in 1991. It is also rare for Slytherin and Gruffindor students to be friendly with one another, and is also quite common for them to share animosity. There are exceptions, such as Slytherin <i>Merlin</i> who had a friendship with Gryffindor <i>Sir Cadogan</i> and Slytherin <i>Severus Snape</i> and Gryffindor <i>Lily Evans</i>, who were best friends until Snape's use of the slur "Mudblood" as well as his aspirations to be a Death Eater caused Lily to sever their ties.<br><br>
            
            Their rivalry was particularly the case during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. During the second war, no Slytherin student joined the association known as <i>Dumbledore's Army</i>; however it is likely the fault of <a href="Hermione_Granger.html">Hermione Granger</a>, <a href="Ron_Weasley.html">Ron Weasley</a>, and <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a>, who only invited people they trusted. The three also shared a deep mistrust of any Slytherins.<br><br>
            
            There is a terrible tension, rivalry, and dislike among Gryffindors Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley, and Slytherin Draco Malfoy to the point that Hermione even once punched Draco. Also, from the moment Harry and Draco met, they became immediate enemies, which was even before they were sorted into their respective houses.<br><br>
            
            Slytherin's relationship with the other houses, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, was variable. By the time of Harry Potter's years at Hogwarts, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw were frustated at Slytherin's seven-year winning streak and readily supported Gryffindor in their efforts to break it, to the extent that they even turned against Harry and his friends when their rule-breaking cost Gryffindor 150 points (and thus the lead) with Slytherin rubbing it at every opportunity. This persisted generally with Quidditch matches, where Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff supported Gryffindor by default if they were facing Slytherin.<br><br>
            
            When Harry was names as a Hogwarts Triwizard champion alongside <a href="Cedric_Diggory.html">Cedric Diggory</a> of Hufflepuff, the three other houses assumed he was trying to steal Hufflepuff's glory and supported Cedric as the 'real' Hogwarts champion, though the Slytherin house may have likely only done this out of spite for Harry rather than any actual support for Cedric. After Cedric's death by Lord Voldemort's hands, the Slytherins joined the rest in toasting his memory but some, like Draco Malfoy, were not saddened by his death.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading">Reputation</h3>
        <img src="/images/FatFriar.png" alt="Fat Friar" title="Fat Friar" class="img" style="float: right;">
        <p class="text">
            Slytherin has a such well-known reputation for creating dark witches and wizards that many would say that every dark witch or wizard was actually in Slytherin. (It also didn't help that Voldemort himself was in Slytherin too when he was a student at Hogwarts) While it is true that many were in the house, it is untrue to say every single one of them was, as <i>Peter Pettigrew</i>, betrayer of James and Lily, was in Gryffindor and <i>Quirinus Quirrell</i> was in Ravenclaw.<br><br>
            
            It appears that reputaion has led to an ironic prejudice against the entire house. It is unknown how many dark witches and wizards were from this house before <i>Tom Riddle</i> began recruiting Death Eaters but many of them came from a family that valued blood purity and would prefer, like Ridlle, to be in the house and recruit from there.<br><br>
            
            In fairer terms, there were many good witches and wizards in the house who opposed the use of the Dark Arts, as well as discrimination based on blood purity, such as <i>Horace Slughorn</i>, <i>Andromeda Tonks</i>, and <i>Leta Lestrange</i>. Andromeda was related to many dark witches and wizards, such as her own sister <i>Bellatrix Lestrange</i>, and brother-in-law <i>Lucius Malfoy</i>, but she chose to forsake the loyalty to her family in favour of marrying the Muggle-born Ted Tonks. Leta was quite different from the majority of her family with her kind-albeit self-deprecating and bitter- personality, he love for both Newt Scamander and Theseus Scamander, her career ambition without ruthlessness, and her self-sacrificing bravery in the face of <i>Gellert Grindelwald</i>, in stark contrast to the usually compassionate Queenie of house Pukwudgie, who joined Grindelward rather quickly. Also, the allegiance of Severus Snape was found to ultimately be towards <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Albus Dumbledore</a> to the point of serving as a triple agent for the <i>Order of Phoenix</i>, in stark contrast to Peter Pettigrew, the former Grynffindor who became a double agent for the Death Eaters instead. Merlin (of King Arthur fame) was also a SLytherin.<br><br>
            
            It might also be possible (though quite unlikely) that the Sorting Hat simply sorts anyone with ill intentions into Slytherin, regardless of whether they possess cunning and ambition, which helped to unfairly give this house a bad name. <i>Vincent Crabbe</i> and <i>Gregory Goyle</i> were incredibly stupid and did not have clever or cunning minds, but were still sorted into Slytherin. They could have possessed one of the minor traits as even Peter Pettigrew was not placed into Gryffindor for bravery, but for chivalry instead.<br><br>
            
            It is also likely that Crabbe and Goyle were simple placed there by process of elimination, since they exhibited virtually none of the qualities valued by any of the other houses (lacking the work ethic or honesty of Hufflepuff, the academic prowess of Ravenclaw, or the bravery of Gryffindor). The Sorting Hat simply could have took into account what house they wished to be places in which, with their family history, was most likely Slytherin.<br><br>
            
            The behaviour of Slytherin house at the Battle of Hogwarts is also debated. The majority of their members departed Hogwarts before the battle started and a few joined their families in becoming Death Eaters. However, many of them returned to Hogwarts to fight against the Death Eaters and were led back by their Head of House, <i>Horace Slughorn</i>.<br><br>
            
            Thr traits of the house are considered obvious examples of people turning towards an ill purpose such as cunning and ambition but they are not inherently negative. Furthermore, traits from the rest of the houses such as daring, intelligence, and loyalty can also become easily negative.<br><br>
            
            Another trait which could be seen as a negative one is self-preservation. The idea that many of them seem to value their own lives more than the lives of others can make them less thought of and trusted, but that is not always the case. <i>Phineas Nigellus</i> gave that impression when he saw Harry Potter trying to run away, because he was afraid that his presence was putting his friends in danger. He stated that <span style="font-style: italic">"We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, when given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks."</span><br><br>
            
            There are exceptions to this rule, however, such as Snape, who Harry said was a <span style="font-style: italic">"Slytherin and... probably the bravest man I ever knew"</span>, and <i>Regulus Black</i> who gave his life in an attempt to destroy one of the <i>Hocruxes of Lord Voldemort</i> and told his house-elf <i>Kreacher</i> to save himself and leave.<br><br>
            
            The truth is that while most Dark wizards are Slytherins, many members of Slytherin House do not have Dark leanings and are even kind and accepting, while smaller groups of Voldemort's supporters are alligned with other Houses. During the Battle of Hogwarts, while all of the Slytherin students left the school before the fighting started, several of them did return with Professor Slughorn as reinforcements to join the fight against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, and some decided to fight as a part of Dumbledore's Army.

        <img src="/images/Slytherin_common_room.jpg" alt="Common Room - Slytherin" title="Common Room - Slytherin" class="img" style="float: right;">
        <p class="text">
            The Slytherin common room is in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle and underneath the Black Lake. Because of this, the light in the common room is green. Harry Potter along with Ron Weasley entered the common room in his second year to find out if Draco Malfoy was the one opening the Chamber of Secrets. To enter the Slytherin common room one must speak aloud the current password in front of a stretch of damp wall; once the word is uttered a concealed stone door will slide aside leaving a rectangular hole in the wall leading to the Slytherin common room. The only known Slytherin password is 'pureblood', used in 1992.
