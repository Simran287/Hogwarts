        <p class="text">
            <b>Professor Remus Lupin</b>, also known as Moony, was a half-blood wizard and the only son of <i>Lyall and Hope Lupin</i>. He was attacked by werewolf <i>Fenrir Greyback</i> when he was a child, as a result of Greyback's revenge against Lyall, leaving Remus afflicted with <b>Lycanthropy</b> for life. He attended <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> from 1971-1978 and was sorted into <a href="Gryffindor.html">Gryffindor House</a>. During his school years he was one of the Marauders, best friends with <b>Sirius Black, James Potter, and Peter Pettigrew.</b> Together, they created the <i>Marauader's Map</i>.<br><br>
            
            After Hogwarts, Remus and his firends joined the original <i>Order of Phoenix</i> and fought in the First Wizarding War. However, Pettigrew betrayed James and Lily Potter to <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a> a week after he was made the couples' <i>Secret Keeper</i>. Thus Remus had lost all of his closest friends in various ways by the end of the First Wizarding War. The loss of his friends devastated him, though he and Sirius Black later rekindled their friendship. <br><br>
            
            Remus taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts during the 1993-1994 school year. Remus was regarded by students to be the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher they have had thus far. He was also a professor of <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a> (James' son) whon he taught how to conjure a corporeal <i>Patronus</i>, but resigned after <a href="Severus_Snape.html">Severus Snape</a> revealed to the public that Remus was a werewolf.<br><br>
            
            He fought against Death Eaters once more in the Second Wizarding War, during which he lost his friend Sirius. In 1997, Remus married fellow Order member <i>Nymphadora Tonks</i> and had a son, <i>Edward Remus Lupin</i>,of whom he named Harry the godfather. Remus fought at the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May, 1998, during which his wife was murdered by <i>Bellatrix Lestrange</i>. Remus was also murdered by Death Eater <i>Antonin Dolohov</i>, during the first half of the same battle. His death was avenged by <a href="Filius_Flitwick.html">Filius Flitwick</a>.

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Remus was born on 10 March, 1960 to Lyall and Hope Lupin. His father worked at the Ministry of Magic and encounted the werewolf <i>Fenrir Greyback</i>, who was on trial for killing of two children. Lyall was the only one at the court to realise that Greyback was a werewolf, as Greyback pretended to be a Muggle tramp. Outraged when Greyback was released, he voiced the opinion that Greyback deserved nothing but death. This opinion cost the Lupin family dearly, as Greyback decided to revenge himself upon Lyall by targeting his son. As the nearly five-year-old Remus slept peacefully in his bed, Greyback forced his way in through the window. Though Lyall was able to get there in time to drive Greyback off with powerful spells, he was unable to prevent him from completing his evil goal. Remus became infected with lycanthropy and he became a werewolf himself. <br><br>
            
            His parents took him to various healers and tried their best to make him a normal boy, but there were no cure for his condition. But Headmaster <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Albus Dumbledore</a> made special accomodations allowing Remus to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Remus was compassionate, intelligent, tolerant, levelheaded, peaceful, selfless, brave, kind, and good-natured. Despite having suffered a great deal of prejudice in his life due to his lycanthropy, he managed to retain an ability to see the good in almost everybody and was extremely forgiving. Remus also had an excellent sense of humour. When he was a student at school he was also part of the Marauderers. However, unlike his friends, he never partook in bullying. He hence could be described as the most mature and responsible one of the group. He even became a prefect in his fifth year. Also he was able to, or at least would try to maintain civil conversation with those he did not get along well with. Remus was unusually perceptive, with an uncanny ability to guess the thoughts of those around him. He was a gifted teacher, with a rare flair for his subject and a profound understanding of his pupils. His perceptive nature is a rather ironic trait, given that wolves are rather intuitive and astute judges of character and communicate primarily through body language, a skill that Remus was extremely developed and talented at. <br><br>
            
            True to being a <a href="Gryffindor.html">Gryffindor</a>, Lupin was quite courageous. Nonetheless, he suffered deep-seated feelings of shame and fear of rejection which, in certain situations, led him to consider backing down. His greatest weakness was that, in his desperate longing to belong and be liked, he was neither as brave or honest as he should have been at times. However, ultimately he came to his senses. He was also known to dislike the form of his Patronus as it tooke the shape of a wolf. Lupin was disgusted by all things wolfish as they reminded him of his condition, and due to this he has been known to deliberately cast a non-corporeal Patronus, particularly when in the company of others, for fear it would give him away as a werewolf. His Boggarts was a full moon, reflecting on his terror of transforming into his werewolf form near humans. It also showed his immense hatred and shame over his condition. <br><br>
            
            In contrast to Sirius' more competitive and combative nature, Remus was far more peaceful, reserved, and prone to negotiation despite his nature as a werewolf. This is symbolic of how dogs often tend to fight for dominance versus the more pragmatic and somewhat democratic nature of wolves in a pack who organise themselves peacefully unless threatened.

                <b>Nymphadora Tonks</b><br>
                Remus and Tonks came to known each other as members of the <i>Order of the Phoenix</i> during the Second Wizarding War. Remus, so often melancholy and lonely, was first amused, then impressed, then seriously smitten by the witch. He had never fallen in love before. It had never occured to Remus that Tonks could return his feelings because he had become so used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. Remus's immediate response was a happiness he had never experienced in his life, but this was extinguished almost at once by a sense of crushing duty. He had always known that he could not marry and run the risk of passing on his painful, shameful condition. Wiser than Remus, she was sure that he loved her, but that he was refusing to admit it out of mistaken nobility.<br>
                
                Inspired by <b>Fleur Delacour</b>'s protestation of enduring love for <b>Bill Weasley</b>, who had been savaged by <b>Greyback</b>, Tonks made a brave, public declaration for her feelings for Remus, who was forced to admit the strength for his love for her. In spite of continuing misgivings that he was acting selfishly, Remus married Tonks quietly in the north of Scotland, with witnesses taken from the local wizarding tavern. He swung constantly between elation that he was married to the woman of his dreams and terror of what he might have brought upon them both. When she became pregnant, Remus was not delighted by this, he was in fact scared that he might be passing his condition on to an innocent child. He even attempted to abandon his pregnant wife and unborn child, but was stopped by Harry Potter. Realising the importance of staying with his family above all else, he returned to Tonks, bitterly ashamed.

                <b>Teddy Lupin</b><br>
                Remus' son was born in 1998. Remus was his wife named him Edward, Teddy for short, after her father Ted Tonks. Despite Remus' earlier fears and insecurities about being a father, Remus expressed joy at his son's birth and asked Harry to be Teddy's godfather. Sadly, Remus and his wife were murdered at the <b>Battle of Hogwarts</b>, leaving Teddy an orphan when he was between two weeks and one month old. When Remus appeared again through the <b>Resurrection Stone</b>, he was rather desvasted knowning that Teddy would have to grow up without either of his parents, but found some solace in knowing that Teddy would be living in a better world. Teddy was raised by his maternal grandmother, but he spent significant time with his godfather's family and the Weasley.

                <b>Marauders</b><br>
                As a Hogwarts student, Remus became good friends with fellow <a href="Gryffindor.html">Gryffindor</a> <b>James Potter, Sirius Black,</b> and <b>Peter Pettigrew</b>. In their second year, Remus' friends figured out that he was a werewolf; instead of shunning him, as many in the wizarding world would have, they learned how to become <i>Animagi</i> by their fifth year to accompany Remus on his monthly transformations, preventing him from hurting himself. Because he was graateful to his friends, Remus cut them a lot of slack; despite being dismayed by their bullying of <a href="Severus_Snape.html">Severus Snape</a>, he did not attempt to stop them. Though he was his house's prefect, Remus had difficulty trying to curb his friends' mischievous behaviour. However, Remus was not without mischief-making streak himself, contributing to the invention of the <b>Marauder's Map</b>. The ending of the three Marauders who had stayed true to their friendship to the very end - James, Sirius, and Remus - was bittersweet: they all lost their lives to the two wizarding wars but were likely reunited in the afterlife.

                <b>Severus Snape</b><br>
                Severus Snape, a <a href="Slytherin.html">Slytherin</a> student in Remus' year, shared a strong enmity with Remus' close friends <b>James Potter and Sirius Black</b>, who outright bullied Snape on occasion. Although not friendly with Snape, Remus never behaved cruelly to him. It is possible that he may have subtly identified with or sympathised with the lonely, isolated Snape, seeing a reflection of himself and how he would have been treated if he hadn't found the protection of his friends. Later in life, he said that he deeply regretted not having done anything to stop the bullying.

                <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
                Remus met Harry Potter, the son of his late friends James and Lily Potter, for the first time since he was an infant, in 1993 when he saved Harry from Dementors on the Hogwarts Express. Remus was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts during Harry's third year, and quickly became his favourite professor. The two bonded very closely. Remus found Harry to be; intelligent, kind, and an excellent Seeker, and had strong empathy for the pain that he had experienced throughout his life. Seeing him as the devoted, informative, fair and supported man he is, Harry admired and cared about Remus even after he found out that he was a werewolf.

                <b>Albus Dumbledore</b><br>
                Albus Dumbledore was considered by many to be the greatest wizard of all time, and Remus Lupin was among his many admirers and staunch supporters. Dumbledore was Remus' Headmaster during his time at Hogwarts. Dumbledore accepted Remus into his school, despite knowning his being a werewolf, as he valued Remus' strength of character and ability, and disregarded the stigma associated with his condition; the headmaster personally approached the Lupin family to invite Remus to school, knowing full well of the circumtances. In fact, it was Dumbledore who, by several special precautions, ensured that Remus' werewolf status was kept secret during his school years, effectively preventing him from being ostracised from his school mates.
