        <i>"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love! The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror?"</i>

        <b>Harry James Potter</b> (born 31 July 1980) was an English half-blood wizard, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter, Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or <a href="/Neville_Longbottom.html">Neville Longbottom</a> as the one with the power to vanquish <a href="/Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a>. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of <a href="/Severus_Snape.html">Severus Snape</a>, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. In turn, this caused the Potter family to go into hiding. Voldemort made his first vain attempt to circumvent the prophecy when Harry was a year and three months old. During this attempt, he murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall. This downfall marked the end of the First Wizarding War, and to Harry henceforth being known as <i>"The Boy Who Lived"</i>, as he was the only known survivor of the <i>Killing Curse</i>. One consequence of Lily's loving sacrifice was that her orphaned son had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative, his Muggle aunt, Petunia Dursley.<br><br>

        Harry was also noted for being the only known <b>Master of Death</b>, having united the three Deathly Hallows at the mere age of seventeen.

    <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
    <p class="text">
        The Potters were also descended from the <i>Peverell family</i>, via Hardwin Potter's marriage to Iolanthe Peverell. As such, they are related to <i>Ignotus Peverell</i>, one of the three brothers that created the Deathly Hallows, who passed the <b>Cloak of Invisibility</b> down to his descendants as a family heirloom. The <i>Gaunt family</i> were also descended from the Peverells through <i>Cadmus Peverell</i>, who passed the <b>Resurrection Stone</b> as an heirloom, set in a signet ring. The Potters were thus indirectly related to the Gaunts as well, and by extension <a href="/Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a><br><br>
        
        Harry James Potter was born on 31 July 1980, at <i>Godric's Hollow</i> in the West Country, England, only hours after his classmate-to-be <a href="/Neville_Longbottom.html">Neville Longbottom</a> Around the same time a prophecy regarding a boy born at the end of July with the power to defeat him. His christening was quiet and quick, with only mother, father, and Sirius Black in attendance. Harry spent his infancy in hiding with his parents in the Potter cottage.<br><br>
        
        When it became clear that Voldemort marked the Potters for death in regards to the prophecy, Albus Dumbledore suggested they use the <i>Fidelius Charm</i> to keep them safe. He even offered to be the Potter's <i>Secret Keeper</i>, but the Potters had planned to make Sirius their Secret Keeper instead. On Sirius' advice, they changed this designation to Peter Pettigrew, who they thought would be less suspicious.[75] In a terrible turn of fate, Pettigrew was a Death Eater spy, and barely a week later betrayed the Potter's whereabouts.<br><br>
        
        On the evening of Hallowe'en in 1981, Lord Voldemort arrived at Godric's Hollow and murdered James and Lily. He murdered James first, who tried to distract the Dark Lord; unfortunately, he did not have his wand with him and was killed immediately. Voldemort then advanced on Lily, who died trying to protect Harry. Her sacrifice prevented the Killing Curse from working on Harry, resulting in her love for Harry becoming a barrier to protecting him. When Voldemort attempted the curse on Harry it backfired on the caster and instead of murdering Harry, Voldemort lost all his powers and his physical form was obliterated.<br><br>
        
        Voldemort was saved from death by the five Horcruxes he had made up to that point, including <b>his diary, Gaunt's ring, Slytherin's locket, Hufflepuff's cup, and Ravenclaw's diadem</b>. Later this also included Harry himself, because a piece of Voldemort's unstable soul latched onto the only living being present. This gave him some of Voldemort's abilities such as the ability to speak <i>Parseltongue</i>. This event made Harry the only person to have survived the Killing Curse, thus giving him the title the <b>"Boy Who Lived"</b>. <i>The failed curse left a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead marking him as Voldemort's equal. The scar would be a bane and also a blessing to Harry in the years to come, as it opened a telepathic link between Lord Voldemort and himself, giving each some awareness of each other's thoughts.</i><br><br>
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
    <p class="text">
        Harry was an extremely brave, loyal, and selfless person who possessed tremendous strength of character. He willingly went to what he truly believed to be his death, because he believed that this was the only way to defeat the Dark Lord. Harry was also marked by what Lord Voldemort once deemed a <i>"weakness for heroics"</i> â€” he would go to great lengths and take great risks in order to help others, particularly his loved ones. Notably, this was taken advantage of by Voldemort in 1996, when he lured Harry to the Department of Mysteries by making him believe that his godfather was in danger. Harry was also very strong-willed and unafraid to stand up for himself. The fact that he was capable of repelling the Imperius Curse suggests that he had an unusually strong sense of himself and his morals. Dumbledore once made parallels between Harry's traits and qualities that Salazar Slytherin looked for in his own hand-picked students. He also noted that Harry's choice not to draw on those qualities really defined who he was, rather than the simple fact that he had them.<br><br>
        

        Harry was perfectly prepared to put his friends' needs and best interests first. The amount of trust that Harry put into his friends was so strong that he absolutely refused to consider that any of them would betray him to Voldemort. The closeness that Harry felt for many was great enough for him to behave violently if any of them were harmed. Ironically, the only people with whom Harry ever initiated a duel were Snape and Bellatrix and he only desired to do so right after they killed someone he loved. This highlights Harry's bravery even further because Harry was fully aware that Snape and Bellatrix were two very skilled and experienced duellists, but did not hesitate to harm them as soon as he was pushed into it.<br><br>

        Harry was prone to moodiness and unkind remarks towards even his friends during his adolescence, though this is likely the result of the great emotional stress and trials he endured during this period. Harry displayed many signs of clinical depression throughout his mid-to-late teens, however this extended to his older life. In his mid-to-late teens, Harry showed signs of these symptoms: general discontent, guilt, hopelessness, mood swings, insomnia (nightmares), agitation, irritability, social isolation and even lack of concentration. These symptoms were continued to be well into his mid ages. It was clear that Harry received limited assistance in his depression during his adolescence, although this was possibly improved in his later life.<br><br>

        Harry was also not one to let bygones be bygones. He had a vindictive streak that made him vengeful at best and spiteful at worse towards those who did him wrong. Harry possessed an instinctual, intuitive intelligence. This intelligence allowed him to make intellectual leaps, as opposed to the logical intelligence of Hermione. Harry also seemed to have a bit of an obsessive personality, a trait he shared with his arch enemy Lord Voldemort. He could be somewhat nosy and was known for sleuthing around and getting involved in things that did not concern him.<br><br>

        Harry's greatest strength was his ability to feel love, despite having a miserable childhood of neglect. Harry was extremely loyal to and protective of his loved ones and that love was what allowed him to overcome Voldemort. Dumbledore noted that Harry's strength of will at resisting the temptation of the Dark Arts, even when granted a direct insight into Voldemort's mind and methods was due to Harry's ability to love. Harry even claimed that he felt sorry for Voldemort because of his inability to feel or understand love. Ginny, his wife, commented that he was the kindest and most loving man anyone would ever meet.<br><br>
        
        Albus Dumbledore noted that Harry was unfailingly kind and compassionate. Although he never sought power himself and would be content with a normal life, when a situation required him to step up he would do so. Harry does have some fears, though he hides them extremely well from his family. In fact he hide them so well that his younger son considered his father to be utterly fearless. These fears include the dark, pigeons, small spaces, and seeing his family in danger.<br><br>

        It is commented by his son that Harry's personality is complicated and this is furthered by Ron, who calls him intense in terms of his traits and past experiences.<br><br>

            <b>Albus Dumbledore</b><br>
            Albus Dumbledore was a mentor to Harry, akin to a grandfather figure. Dumbledore arranged for Harry to be rescued from Godric's Hollow after his parents' murder and left him in the care of his aunt Petunia Dursley in order to give him the benefit of the magical protection of his mother's blood. In Harry's fifth year, he admitted to Harry that he had not told him of the prophecy concerning himself and Voldemort, because he wanted to spare Harry the pain and responsibility it would burden him with for as long as possible. Though Harry was initially furious with him for the frustration he felt for being kept in the dark, the two continued to be close. Harry continued to have utmost faith in him, proclaiming to Rufus Scrimgeour that he was Dumbledore's man through and through, something Dumbledore was very touched by. By Harry's sixth year, Dumbledore took on the role of providing Harry with additional insights into the origins of Lord Voldemort, largely through the use of the Pensieve. He entrusted Harry with the task of getting a final, crucial memory from Horace Slughorn regarding Voldemort's knowledge of Horcruxes. Dumbledore's death was greatly devastating to Harry, though he persevered in the impossibly difficult task Dumbledore had left him of finding and destroying each of Voldemort's Horcruxes.<br>
            
            The fact that Dumbledore himself was there to meet Harry in a place between life and death attested to the bond of fellowship between them. They discussed all that had happened to Harry since Dumbledore's death, as well as things that had remained unsaid prior to it. At one point, Dumbledore seemed to beg for Harry's reassurance, uncharacteristically doubting some of the decisions he had made in the course of his life, which Harry easily gave him. Though Harry had felt some resentment for how little he felt Dumbledore had actually revealed of himself in their time together, Harry probably learned secrets and saw a side of Dumbledore that no one else knew during the events at "King's Cross".<br>

            Harry also had a unique relationship with the Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes; not only was Harry's wand one of the only two ever made with feathers from Fawkes's tail, but the phoenix found Harry in the Chamber of Secrets, helped him slay Slytherin's Basilisk, and provided Harry with the only known antidote to Basilisk venom: phoenix tears. Fawkes's song was a source of comfort for Harry on a number occasions before the phoenix left Hogwarts following Dumbledore's death.<br>
            
            Minerva never hesitated in displaying her loyalty to Dumbledore. When <i>Cornelius Fudge</i> brought Aurors to arrest Dumbledore in 1996. she boldly stepped forward and announced her intention to fight the Aurors on his behalf. She only stepped back at Dumbledore's insistence when he reminded her that Hogwarts and her students would need her in her absence. Minerva devasted when Dumbledore was killed in 1997 during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and arranged his funeral. A year later, when Harry was on a mission given to him by Dumbledore, she didn't question the decision of the late headmaster, but immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could.<br>

            <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
            Minerva showed her care for Harry ever since she, Dumbledore and Hagrid left him in the care of the Dursleys, in part because she had been quite fond of Harry's late parents. She was sort of a loving grandmother to him and expressed concern with both Dumbledore's choice trusting Hagrid to safely transport Harry to Little Whinging, and of the choice of family with whom Harry would stay. She spent hours on end spying on the Dursleys to get an insight to what life for Harry growing up would be like, calling them "the worst sort of Muggles imaginable". It is unlikely, however, that she kept watch over Harry, as she would never go against Dumbledore's actions, no matter how much she disagreed with them.<br>
            
            The two continued to have a very positive relationship over the following years. Harry acted as a frequent guest lecturer on Defense Against The Dark Arts, under Minerva's jurisdiction. She would serve as Headmistress over Harry's three children, and in turn she learned to expect them to get into the same kinds of trouble as their father. This was to be expected, after having now taught and served over three generations of Potters. Minerva's relationship with Harry experienced a brief strain when he blackmailed her into using the Marauder's Map to ensure Albus and Scorpius remains apart, which she felt great discontent at doing, but it was reconciled when Harry apologised and she wasn't shown to hold any ill-will afterwards.<br>
