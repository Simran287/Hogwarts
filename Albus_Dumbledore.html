            <i>Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is nothing compared to the Wizarding World's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived; working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day I met him.</i>

            <b>Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore</b>, was an English half-blood wizard, who was the <i>Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor</i>, later the <i>Transfiguration Professor</i>, and later the <i>Headmaster</i> of <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. Professor Dumbledore also served as <i>Supreme Mugwump</i> of the <i>International Confederation of Wizards</i> and <i>Chief Warlock</i> of the <i>Wizangamot</i>. He was a half-blood, Muggle-supporting wizard considered to have been the greatest wizard of modern times, perhaps of all times. The son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother of Aberforth and Ariana. His father died in Azkaban when Dumbledore was young, while his mother and sister were later accidentally killed. His early losses greatly affected him early on, even at his death, but, in turn, made him a better person.<br><br>
        
            While initially unable to directly act against <i>Gellert Grindelwald</i>, due to their past Blood pact, the Ministry's survellance of him, his lingering feelings of love toward Grindelwald, and his lingering guilt over Ariana's death, Dumbledore sent <i>Newt Scamander</i> to New York to release the <i>Thunderbird Frank</i>, and later sent Newt to Paris to rescue <i>Credence Barebone</i>. After the tragic death of <i>Leta Lestrange</i> in Paris, Dumbledore became determined to contribute helpful advice to the resistance against Grindelwald, notably Newt, Theseus, Tine, Jacob, Yusuf, and Nagini in the <i>Global Wizarding War</i>. Initially unbeknownst to Dumbledore however, Grindelwald intended to use the former's alleged Obscurial relative, <i>Aurelius Dumbledore</i>, as a weapon against him.<br><br>
        
            Following the Global Wizarding War and the end of the <i>For the Greater Good</i> revolution, regardless of Aurelius Dumbledore's fate, Dumbledore became the most famous for defeating Grindelwald in arguably the most epic duel of all time. Dumbledore also gained much more recognition with his involvement in the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood and his work on alchemy with <i>Nicholas Flamel</i>.<br><br>
            
            It was through Dumbledore that resistance to the rise of <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a> was formed, as it was he who founded and lead the <i>Order of the Phoenix</i> against Voldemort during the <i>First Wizarding War</i>. Following Voldemort's sudden return and the start of the <i>Second Wizarding War</i> after the resignation of <i>Cornelius Fudge</i>, Dumbledore swiftly formed and lead the second Order of Phoenix. He would also support Jacob's sibling in the latter's quest for the <i>Cursed Vaults</i>, and consistently aid the trio of <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry</a>, <a href="Ron_Weasley.html">Ron</a>, and <a href="Hermione_Granger.html">Hermione</a> during their first six years at Hogwarts, thus leading them to name <i>Dumbledore's Army</i> after him.<br><br>
            
            Due to the fact that he had a keen mind and legendary power, Dumbledore became the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. He was the wielder and the master of the <i>Elder Wand</i> from 1945 until 19997 and considered by many as the greatest Hogwarts Headmaster. As he was about to die by a cursed ring, Dumbledore planned his own death with <a href="Severus_Snape.html">Severus Snape</a>. Per the plan, Dumbledore was killed by Snape during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.<br><br>
            
            Though he was no longer alive at the time, it was through Dumbledore's manipulations that Lord Voldemort was ultimately defeated and lasting peace finally restored to the wizarding world. Dumbledore is the only Headmaster that was laid to rest at Hogwarts. A potrait of him still remains at Hogwarts. Harry Potter later named his second son <i>Albus Severus Potter</i> after him.

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was born to <i>Kendra and Percival Dumbledore</i> in the summer of 1881, in the mainly wizarding village of <i>Mould-on-the-Wold</i>. The early years of Dumbledore's life were marked by tragedy when his younger sister, <i>Ariana Dumbledore</i>, was attacked by a group of Muggle boys, who saw her performancing magic and were frightened by what they saw.<br><br>
            
            Ariana was left mentally and emotionally scarred by the event and her magical powers were left severely altered by the event and would manifest themselves on rare occasions usually in random or destructive ways. Albus' father, Percival Dumbledore, was heartbroken and set out in search of his own brand of justice. He located the Muggle boys and attacked them , as they had his daughter. For this, Percival was sentenced to Azkaban where he later died, choosing the sentence over explaining why he had attacked the boys as it would have meant Ariana being taken away.<br><br>
            
            To escape the accusing eyes of the wizarding world, Kendra Dumbledore moved her young family to the village of <i>Godric's Hollow</i> which, like Mould-on-the-Wold, preferring to be left alone; and Albus learned not to mention his sister or father in public<br><br>
            
            Dumbledore began attending Hogwarts in the autummn of 1892 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. Dumbledore's first year was met with much whispering about his father's crime. Many of Albus' fellow students mistakenly believed that, like father like son, Albus too hated Muggles. Some praised his father's actions, hoping to gain his trust, but they would not find favour with the young Dumbledore this way. Though later in his young life, under the influence of his love for <i>Gellert Grindelwald</i>, some anti-Muggle prejudice did develop, but he soon saw the error of his intent.<br><br>
            
            He befriended a young <i>Elphias Doge</i> on his first day at Hogwarts; Doge was suffering from the aftermath of Dragon Pox at the time (greenish skin and pockmarks), which discouraged most from approaching him. Dumbledore, however, demostrated his uncommon kindness and willingness to look past the surface and find inner beauty in people. Dumbledore also became very well-connected during his Hogwarts years, making notable friends such as <i>Nicholas Flamel, Bathilda Bagshot, and Griselda Marchbanks</i>, who marked him in his N.E.W.T.s for Charms and Transfiguration and later recalled that he did things with his wand that she had never seen before. He also had several of his papers published during his studies and exchanged letters with theoritician <i>Adalbert Waffling</i>. <a href="Minerva_McGonagall.html">Minerva McGonagall</a> later shared these letter with members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursured a Professorship profession to help improve their skills in addressing the Calamity.<br><br>
            
            Albus was made a prefect during his fifth year and was made <i>Head Boy</i> in his seventh year. At some point over the course of his school career, Dumbledore also won the <i>Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting</i>, became the <i>British Young Representative to the Wizengamot</i>, and received the <i>Gold Medal for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference</i> in Cairo, not to mention the recognition of having been arguably the most brilliant student to have ever attended the school.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Considered by many to be the most powerful wizards of all time, Dumbledore was benevolent was wise, a great wizard in the vein of Merlin. He had an almost unearthly calm and relaxed demeanour and almost constantly gave off an auro of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emothion of anger or fear. He was known for typically speaking in a calm, collected voice, and being firm, but reasonable and kind. He was always courteous, even to people who he found rude or in the case of Fenrir Greyback, disgusting. However, despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a> ever truly feared. <br><br>
            
            Dumbledore was notably eccentric. He was quite fond of knitting patterns and wore flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet that he received from a Wizard Cracker). In particular, he had a somewhat odd taste in sweets; he enjoyed Muggle sweets relatively unknown in the wizarding world (particularly sherbet lemons) and the password to his office, supposedly that of his current favourite sweet, was often peculiar choices such as Acid Pops and Cockroach Clusters. In addition, he had a liking for chamber music as well as ten-pin bowling. He often used humour to make people feel comfortable in his presence. Dumbledore has been known to be quite philosophical; often, very few people have the understanding (or patience) to comprehend his philosophies.<br><br>
            
            As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore showed numerous examples of extraordinary abilities. His capabilities as a wizard were combines with his extrardinary intellect and extremely cunning and subtle mind that allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular. Due to this, Dumbledore wielded extraordinary powers of deduction that allowed him to be completely unfooled by any charades who could even fool the entire wizarding world and recognise instantly any deception that many have initially fooled him at the slighest of slip ups, as shown repeatedly when he quickly figured out Quirell was distracting him with a letter he faked was from the Ministry of Magic, was never fooled by Lockhart's books due to having know that he truly was and quickly realised the truth, and deduced that Moody was actually Crouch Jr the moment he asked Harry to be brought to his office. During his Hogwarts career, especially as headmaster Dumbledore always maintained his composure, even in situations that would terrify others. Being attacked by Ministry officials, the opening/re-opening of the Chamber of Secrets, having Dementors at the school, being surrounded by a plethora of Inferi and soon thereafter, staring death in the face (although they may have made him uneasy for the safety of others) did not frighten him. This was shown best at his duel with Voldemort, when he engaged in small with him in a calm, almost sardonically humorous way, despite Voldemort's tremendous duelling prowess and his attempts to murder him. Dumbledore was verbally and utterly unafraid of death and was obviously never scared of Voldemort himself, but rather what he may/could do to those he cared for and he was also not afraid of being exposed to great torment. An example of this was in <i>The Cave</i>, when knowing that the potion would cause him severe pain and distress without knowing exactly what would happen to him, Dumbledore did not hesitate to drink it. Despite this, Dumbledore was capable of fear and feared, above all else, that he had actually cast the spell that ended his sister Ariana's life. However, he was capable of facing his fears, as shown by how he indirectly confessed his guilt to <i>Leta Lestrange</i>, and by how he later ultimately mustered the strength to confront Grindelwald and end the Global Wizarding War after years of watching Grindelwald's rampage. Therefore, Dumbledore's Boggart is said to be his sister's corpse.<br><br>
            
            While Dumbledore (atleast in his later years) never displayed arrogance or conceit, he had no use of false modesty either, and if a situation warrented it, was perfectly willing to acknowledge his virtually peerless intelligence and power. He once told Harry that was fairly confident in his ability to defeat Gellert Grindelwald despite the latter's own great skill and possession of the Elder Wand. Dumbledore's portrait also professed to Harry that he had considered personally fighting Voldemort for Harry, further showing Dumbledore's self-confidence. However, Dumbledore also understood that he had his weaknesses and blind spots just as any other man, and worked hard to keep them in check.<br><br>
            
            Dumbledore was highly perceptive and emotionally intelligent; his knowledge of people's true personality went beyond being simple a good judge of character. This is never more apparent than in his complex insights into Voldemort's psyche, which he pieced together with Harry to deduce where the Horcruxes were hidden. However, this insight also made him extraordinarily good at manipulating people, which he was perfectly willing to do if thought it necessary. Perhaps the most blatant example of this was with regard to Severus Snape, as he used Snape's love for late Lilly Evans to manipulate him into helping him protect Harry Potter, he son, despite all the risks it entailed and despite Snape's bitterness and hatred towards Harry's father.<br><br>
            
            In spite of Dumbledore's manu extraordinary qualities, he was also a somewhat Machiavellian figure. He could be stoically pragamatic and was extremely prone to secrecy. He spent a short portion of his youth concocting plans with Gellert Grindelwald for global domination over Muggles, in the process treating his ill sister with neglect. Whilst Dumbledore was never a deliberately cruel man, at times, he was too far-sighted, making choices that he believed to be for the benefit of humanity even if it deeply hurt some of the people around it. For example, he placed Harry Potter with the Dursley family despite knowing that they would be unikely to treat him well, as pointed out by Professor McGonagall, all for the sake of keeping him alive.<br><br>
            
            Dumbledore, while often kind and calm, did have a very serious side of himself and was capable of a terrifying wrath. This was rarely seen, but appears to be well known and combined with his exceptional magical abilities, made very few of his allies willing to cross him and almost all of his enemies feared him, to the point that even Lord Voldemort and Gellert Grindelwald were known for fearing him, despite their own incredible magical powers, wrath and status as the two most dangerous dark wizards in history. Even a slight exertion of Dumbledore's serious side and anger could intimidate the like of Harry Potter, and even the Minister of Magic <i>Cornelius Fudge</i>, evidenced when they both were shocked when Dumbledore made it clear quite firmly that Hagrid did not open the Chamber of Secrets, despite Dumbledore not showing anger. Additionally, rather than shouting when Harry entered Hogwarts with the Ford Anglia, and when Harry failed to get Slughorn's memory, just an expression of calm disappointment on both ocassions was enough to make Harry feel ashamed to the point that he found it preferable if Dumbledore shouted at him. At the apex of Dumbledore's wrath, which happened extremely rarely, such as when he apprenhended <i>Barty Crouch Jr</i>, who impersonated Moody and almost killed Harry, Dumbledore was described as "being struck with cold, ancient fury". In fact, during this rare moment of intense anger (cased by Dumbledore's realisation that, not only had Voldemort been resurrected, but also that he had been expertly deceived for an entire year), Dumbledore was so terrifying, that even <a href="Minerva_McGonagall.html">Minerva McGonagall</a> and <a href="Severus_Snape.html">Severus Snape</a>, both extremely powerful and stern wizards who rarely displayed emotions, were clearly uneasy. Harry himself (who was slightly terrified of his reaction) fully understood then why Dumbledore was the only wizards that Voldemort ever feared. In addition to being completely unintimidated but rather saddened by Harry's profound bursts of rage regarding Sirius, in all the other times Harry unleashed his anger, Dumbledore proved himself capable of quelling even Harry's anger with just a slight exertion of his dark side, as he silenced Harry's questions regarding his judgement of Darco and Snape and even silenced Harry's anger with just indicating he had crossed the line, showing even Harry's rage could not match the seriousness and fury the old but extraordinarily powerful wizard was capable of.<br><br>

                <b>Parents</b><br>
                Albus' relationship with his parents was not very clear. However, it can be theorised that he most likely did not hold his father in high regard, as he was imprisoned in Azkaban for magically attacking three Muggle boys who had inflicted permanent psychological damage on Ariana. According to Aberforth, their mother taught Albus secrecy. Given that she read stories to him, it can be assumed that Albus had a good relationship with her, or atleast better one than the one she had with Aberforth. <br>
                Later on, during his conversation with Harry in limbo, he confessed that he truly loved each and every one of his family, but was blinded by his ambition and his madness.

                Albus Dumbledore was Ariana Dumbledore's eldest brother, and was not nearly as close to his younger siblings as they were to each other. Although he loved his younger sister, Albus was resentful when he had to take responsibility for her after her mother's death, which forced him to stay at home, and thus abandon his ambitious plans. Dumbledore was also haunted with the fear that it had been him to kill Ariana, to the point that he delayed facing Grindelwald for years.

                Aberforth Dumbledore was Albus' youger brother. Although Albus loved him, the two brothers were not close to each other, as they were very different persons in both personality, with Aberforth resenting being in Albus' shadow. Despite not being close, it cannot be doubted that Albus loved and cared for him dearly, evidenced by the fact that even though he resented having to stay at home, Albus still refused to allow Aberforth to stop his education out of concern of his brother's future.<br>
                Aberforth however, eventually changed his opinions of his brother when Harry Potter helped him realise what Albus' intention really was and had forgiven him, as he chose to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts.

                <b>Newt Scamander</b><br>
                Dumbledore's relationship with famous magizoologist was very close. During Newt's time at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was his Defense Againts the Dark Arts Professor. When one of Leta Lestrange's experiments involving a magical beast went too far, endangering the life of another student. Newt did not want to a see a friend thrown out of school, so he took the blame for Leta's actions, and was thus sentenced to be expelled from Hogwarts in her place. Albus developed unending trust and loyalty to him after he argued strongly against his expulsion. Newt respected his mentor enough to do tasks for him.

                <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
                <b>Tom Riddle</b><br>
                Dumbledore met Tom Riddle for the first time in the orphanage he lived in and was unaware at the time that he had just met the person who would become most powerful and dangerous Dark Wizard of all time. He was however intrigued by Tom Riddle as his powers were surprisingly well-developed by such a young wizard who had begun to use them consciously. Dumbledore was also disturbed by the fact that Tom was a Parselmouth, a rare ability supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although not much as the fact that Tom had obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy and domination which was proved by the fact that Tom had used his magic to hurt the other children in the orphanage.<br>
                It was clear that while many who followed Dumbledore's cause both feared and despised Voldemort greatly, Dumbledore did not share such viewd as he had known Tom Riddle personally, and although he was committed to defeating him, Dumbledore held no personal resentment nor fear towards the Dark Lord and continued to see him as his former student worthy of being pitied for his childhood and complete inability to understand love, as he had never received any. He even appeared to feel some deep-rooted guilt and remorse over his inability to change Riddle, as he noted with great sadness in his face and tone that he sincerely wished he could have forced Voldemort to repent for his sins in a peaceful manner. Dumbledore understood the evil in Riddle as a result from a string of unfortunate events and performed intensive research on him, eventually discovering his Horcruxes. After Riddle's transformation into Lord Voldemort, contrary to the rest of the wizarding community's fear of saying the Dark Lord's name, Dumbledore, as the only person Voldemort (secrectly) feared, refused to be intimidated by the Dark Lord, referring to him as "Voldemort" to others and as "Tom" in conversation with Voldemort himself, a subtle but steadfast refusal to allow Lord Voldemort to dictate the terms of their relationship and a trait that would later be inherited by Harry Potter.

                <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
                <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
                Dumbledore was well known for the care and steadfast championing of Harry Potter. It was Dumbledore who planned and wanted the infant Harry to be taken from the cottage at Godric's Hollow where Harry's parents had been murdered, taking him away from him godfather and rightful guardian. He then left Harry in the care of Harry's Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.<br>
                Harry and Dumbledore forged a strong Student - Headmaster bond, comparable to the between two close family members (most likely case of a great-grandfather - grandson), in spite of the century in age difference. Harry felt comfortable enough around the impressive, intimidating figure of Dumbledore to shout at him in frustation, cry out of grief, admit to his fears and entrust with his life. Dumbledore in return considered Harry to be a talented and powerful wizard who had inherited his parents' best qualities, noting that Harry was a leader of superior quality to himself, as Harry led becuase others looked to him to lead them rather than because he had ever sought power or authority for himself. He also had great faith in Harry as shown when Dumbledore was in a weakened state and Harry, who has never Apparated beyond a few feet, had to Apparate them both back. Dumbledore told Harry that he wasn't worried because because he was with Harry. <br>
                Before the final event of the <i>Battle of Hogwarts</i>, after Harry sacrificed himself and was struck by Voldemort's Killing Curse and nearly died back in the Forbidden Forest, his soul went to a place resembling King's Cross Station, where Dumbledore was waiting to speak with him. The fact that Dumbledore himself was there to meet Harry in a place between life and death attests to the bond of fellowship between them. After the war, Harry also named him second son after Dumbledore.

                <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
                <b>Minerva McGonagall</b><br>
                Minerva McGonagall knew Dumbledore for the majority of her life. She attended Hogwarts as a student during Dumbledore's time as the Transfiguration Professor and later went on to replace him when he took the position of Head of the school.<br>
                Minerva had great faith in Dumbledore, placing great stock in the differences between him and Voldemort. However, she did not hesistate to disagree with him when she felt the need to do so. She was extremely opposed to his disagree with him when she felt the need to do so. She was extremely opposed to his decision to place Harry Potter with the magical hating Petunia Dursley and her family, calling them the "worst sort of Muggles imaginable". <br>
                Minerva had no qualms about displaying her loyalty to Dumbledore. When Cornelius Fudge brought Aurors to arrest Dumbledore in 1996, she boldly stepped forward and announced her intention to fight the Aurors on his behalf. She only stepped back at Dumbledore's insistence when he reminded her that Hogwarts and her students wuld need her in his absence.

                <b>Severus Snape</b><br>
                Snape's relationship with Dumbledore was one of close, but one indefinite trust. After indirectly and accidentally sending Voldemort after Lilly, Snape turned to Dumbledore to keep her safe. Dumbledore chose to capitalise on Snape's remorse and initiated him into the Order of Phoenix as a double agent.<br>
                It is notable that Dumbledore did not confide completely in Snape, thereby minimising the potential damage that might occur if Snape was compromised. Snape resented Dumbledore's secrecy, and offended by this lack of faith in his abilities. However, when Snape discovered that he had been used as a pawn in Harry's own destruction, he was horrified, seeing it as a calculated betrayal of Lily's memory.

                Albus Dumbledore had a very strong bond with Fawkes, his pet pheonix, who served as a messenger and close companion. Dumbledore always looked after Fawkes when he was reborn after his countless deaths and in return Fawkes was extremely loyal to him. Fawkes was willing to take a killing curse in order to protect Dumbledore, and did so in order to defend him from Lord Voldemort. He also helped Albus escape from several members of the Ministry of Magic when they tried to arrest him. When Dumbledore died Fawkes mourned him by singing a lament and then left Hogwarts and was apparently never seen again.
