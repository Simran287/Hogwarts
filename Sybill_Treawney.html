            <b>Professor Sybill Patricia Trelawney</b> was a half-blood witch and professor of <i>Divination</i> at <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. She is the great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated <b>Cassandra Trelawney</b>, who was also a <i>Seer</i>. <br><br>
            
            It was Trelawney herself who made the prophecy concerning <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a> and the one with the power to vanquish him (Voldemort took this to mean <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a>) during her job interview with <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Albus Dumbledore</a>. At the end of the 1993-1994 school year, she accurately predicted the escape of <i>Peter Pettigrew</i> and return of Lord Voldemort. In the 1995-1996 school year, Trelawney was greatly distressed by <a href="Dolores_Umbridge.html">Dolores Umbridge</a>, who dismissed her and attempted her to remain at the school, with Umbridge being greatly offended when she later had to teach alongside the centaur <i>Firenze</i>. In the 1997-1998 school year, she participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, dropping crystal balls on Death Eaters' heads and tending to the wounded and dead along with the <i>Padma Patil</i>.

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Sybill was born on 9 March in an unknown year, to a Muggle mother and wizard father, into the half-blood Trelawney family. There were three generations between her and Cassandra Trelawney, who was a renowned Seer. No one in the family since Cassandra had possessed the Second Sight. Presumably purchasing or inheriting her wand at the age of eleven, Sybill attended <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, which she referred to as her home. Being Sorted into <a href="Ravenclaw.html">Ravenclaw</a> by 1973 at the latest, she may have been a member of the <i>Slug Club</i> because of her ancestry. In her third year, Sybill would have taken Divination as one of her elective subjects in her third year, and achieved high grades in her O.W.L and N.E.W.T. She married early, but it ended in unforeseen rupture due to Sybill's refusal to adopt the surname Higglebottom. They had no children. After graduating, Syble drifted through the wizarding world, trying to gain employment based on her ancestry but scorning those who did not offer what she felt was the rightful treatment of a true Seer.

        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Trelawney was extremely eccentric; she had a theatrical presence and frequently spoke in mistry, ethereal tones. She saw herself as being a great Seer, although her predictions rarely came true. Much like <b>Gilderoy Lockhart</b>, Trelawney was sometimes unable to understand who liked and who disliked her. She was, however, conscious of her low status amongst the staff, which led to her spending most of her time apart from her colleagues in her office. According to <a href="Minerva_McGonagall.html">Professor McGonagall</a>, seeing death omens was a favourite way for Trelawney to greet her class something that greatly annoyed <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a> as he was her frequent target. One of her hobbies was practising doom-laden prophecies in front of the mirror. She became angered when she believed that students were not impressed by nor interested in her subject, such as <a href="Ron_Weasley.html">Ronald Weasley</a> and <a href="Hermione_Granger.html">Hermione Granger</a>. <br><br>
            
            Due to being constantly harassed by the <a href="Dolores_Umbridge.html">Hogwarts High Inquisitor</a>, Trelawney developed a drinking problem; a number of times Harry detected the smell of old sherry on her, and at one point, she was seen stowing away empty alcohol bottles in the <i>Room of Requirement</i>. She was very sensitive, most notable when <a  href="Dolores_Umbridge.html">Dolores Umbridge</a> placed her on probation and then dismissed her. Trelawney expressed on how she believed that all of the High Inquisitor's questionings and demands were an insult to a self-proclaimed Seer, but her own inability to cope with the pressure led to a spiralling emotional breakdown that Umbridge considered to be an embarrassment to the rest of the school. Sybill was, however, loyal to the school and defended it during the Battle of Hogwarts.

                <b>Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil</b><br>
                <i>Lavender Brown</i> and <i>Parvati Patil</i> seemed to have an exceptionally close relationship with Sybill Trelawney; they had an unwavering faith in the reliability of Trelawney's predictions, and were often seen comforting her and seeking out her company. The two girls often spent lunch periods in the North Tower with Trelawney, returning to the other Gryffindors with smug looks as though they knew something the others did not. For her part, Trelawney seemed to return their genuine affection for them.

                <b>Dolores Umbridge</b><br>
                Sybill Trelawney strongly disliked <a href="Dolores_Umbridge.html">Dolores Umbridge</a>, the <b>Defense Against the Dark Arts</b> professor and later <b>Hogwarts High Inquisitor</b> because of the way the pink nightmare treated her during her insulting inspections of Sybill's Divination classes as well as being asked to predict on command. It was during Umbridge's reign at Hogwarts when Harry, who did not like Trelawney very much, felt pity for her. Umbridge believed that Trelawney was an old fraud and, true to her duties of High Inquisitor to weed out any unsatisfactory teachers, eventually sacked her in a rather unceremonious - and even cruel - way.

                <b>Minerva McGonagall</b><br>
                Professor Trelawney and <a href="Minerva_McGonagall.html">Minerva McGonagall</a> were colleagues as professors at <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. McGonagall had no use for Trelawney's subject, Divination, politely describing it as an 'imprecise' branch of magic. She also, like many others, believed that Trelawney was a fraud. Despite her distate for Trelawney and her teachings, the professors would grow to understand one another through their shared hatred of <a href="Dolores_Umbridge.html">Dolores Umbridge</a> during the woman's tenure as the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. When Dolores sacked Trelawney, McGonagall comforted her and spoke out against Umbridge's behaviour. In many ways, Mcgonagall's relationship with Trelawney was similar to <a href="Hermione_Granger.html">Hermione Granger</a>'s relationship with <a href="Luna_Lovegood.html">Luna Lovegood</a>.

                <b>Albus Dumbledore</b>
                Upon their first meeting, <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Albus Dumbledore</a> initially believed that she did not have the gifts of second sight, but when he heard her prophecy about <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Voldemort</a>, he hired her in order to protect her from the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters. Although Dumbledore was sceptical of Divination, he was fond of Trelawney. He did concede that she made two real prophecies, leading him to lightly joke that he should give her a pay rise.
