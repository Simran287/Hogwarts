            <i>"Speaking of eccentrics, you'll like our Head of House, Professor Filius Flitwick. People often underestimate him, because he's really tiny (we think he's part elf, but we've never been rude enough to ask) and he's got a squeaky voice, but he's the best and most knowledgeable Charms master alive in the world today. His office door is always open to any Ravenclaw with a problem, and if you're in a real state he'll get out these delicious little cupcakes he keeps in a tin in his desk drawer and make them do a little dance for you. In fact, it's worth pretending you're in a real state just to see them jive"</i>

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Filius Flitwick was born somewhere in the British Isles into a wizarding family with the distant descent of a goblin, which accounted for his short stature. By the time young Filius began attending <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, he was already used to being judged by strangers. Wise beyond his years and rather thick-skinned, he eventually came to regard those who judged him as ignorant rather than malevolent,reasoning that most people simply want those around them to be simple so that they would be easier to understand, as opposed to simply acknowledge the fact that people are complex. During his <i>Sorting Ceremony</i>, when the Sorting Hat wavered between putting him in Ravenclaw or Gryffindor before it ultimately chose the former.<br><br>
            
            After completing his <i>Nastily Exhasting Wizarding Tests</i> in his seventh year, Flitwick graduated from Hogwarts and then proceeded to become a <i>Master Duellist</i> and earned the title of "Duelling Champion" at some point, and has a shelf full of trophies to prove it. <br><br>
            
            Known for his rick sense of humour, Filius was always fair with his students, even those who are not in Ravenclaw. Due to his heritage and the judgement he sometimes experienced because of it, Flitwick did not discriminate against those of different backgrounds and was inclined to allow people the benefit of the doubt.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Flitwick was an emotional fellow, who seemed to have a gentle spirit. He was also shown to have a sense of mischief and fun. He sarcastically remarked to <a href="Dolores_Umbridge.html">Dolores Umbridge</a> that, while he easily had the ability to remove Fred and George's rampaging fireworks, he wasn't sure if he had the authority. He also discretly cheered the Weasley Twins' escape from the school, and left a small patch of the twin's Portable Swamp under the window, which Ron believed he had done as a monument to Fred and Geaorge.<br><br>
            
            Flitwick was considerably more tolerant of disobedience than most of his fellow professors, known for rarely handing out detentions and deducting House Points, his more laid-back and forgiving teaching attitude making him particularly liked and respected by the students.  Nevertheless, he commanded respect in spite of his sensitive nature and small stature.

                <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
                Professor Flitwick was kind to <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a> and had a good relationship with him. He allowed Harry and his friends to talk during classes, as well as play games sometimes.

                <b>Ravenclaw students</b><br>
                Professor FLitwick was very caring and protective of the members of his House, <a href="Ravenclaw.html">Ravenclaw</a>, as he was Head of Ravenclaw House. Flitwick protected the Ravenclaws, as well as the other students, from the Carrows, as did McGonagall, Sprout and Slughorn. Once <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a> declared war on the Castle, Flitwick fought in the <i>Battle of Hogwarts</i> and survived, so he likely continued to teach and care for the next generation of Ravenclaws.
