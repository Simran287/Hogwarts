            <p class="text"><b>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</b> is the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepts magical students from Great Britain and Ireland for enrolment. It is a state-owned school funded by the Ministry of Magic. <br><br> The precise location of the school can never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school looks like an old abandeoned castle. Similarly, most wizardinf schools areprotected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.</p>

            <p class="text">Hogwarts School, located somewhere in the ehighlands of Scotland, consists of the large <i>Hogwarts Castle</i> and the extensive school grounds surrounding it, which include sloping lawns, flowerbeds, vegetable patches, as well as loch (called the <i>Black Lake</i>), a large dense forest (called the <i>Forbidden Forest</i>), several greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size <i>Quidditch Pitch</i>. One of the castle's towers holds an <i>owlery</i>, which houses all the owls owned by the school and by students.<br><br>The castle is set upon huge rocks above a magnificant lake, known as the <i>Great Lake</i>. Its highest towers  are the <i>Astronomy, Ravenclaw and Gryffindor</i> Towers. The castle's 142 staircases are known to change position. The castle is known for its many updates and changes in layout throughout the years, such as self-regeneration after the <i>Battle of Hogwarts</i>. It should be noted that some rooms in the school tend to "move around", as do the steps in the <i>Grand Staircase</i>. <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html"><i>Albus Dumbledore</i></a> once noted that even he did not know all of Hogwarts' secrets. The castle has been around for centuries, and consequently has a long history of ancient magic.<br><br>The school has numerous charms and spells on and aorund it that make it impossible for a <i>Muggle</i> to see it as the school; rather they see only ruins and several warnings of danger. Witches and wizards cannot <i>Apparate</i> or <i>Disaparate</i> in Hogwarts grounds, except for when the Headmaster lifts the enchantment, whether to allow Apparition. Electricity and electronic devices are not found at Hogwarts. Due to the high levels of magic, Muggle substitutes for magic, such as computers, radar and electricity, "go haywire" around Hogwarts. Radios, however, are an exception as they are not powered by electricity, but by magic.</p>

            <h3 class="headings">History</h3>
            <p class="text">Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizrds and witches of the age: <a href="Gryffindor.html"><b>Godric Gryffindor</b></a>, <a href="Hufflepuff.html"><b>Helga Hufflepuff</b></a>, <a href="Ravenclaw.html"><b>Rowena Ravenclaw</b></a>, and <a href="Slytherin.html"><b>Salazar Slytherin</b></a>. They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students. However, shortly after founding the school, Slytherin hada falling out with the other founders about <i>blood purity</i>, and wanted to admit only pure-blood students. He felt pure-blooded students deserved to learn magic,and those of other ancestry such as Muggle-borns and Half-bloods, were unworthy. The other three founders all disagreed, especially Gryffindor. Slytherin left the school, but not before secretly building the <a href="Books.html"><i>Chamber of Secrets</i></a>. He foretold that only <i>his own heir</i> would be able to open it once he or she arrived at the school, and the heir would unleash a murderous <i>basilisk</i> living inside to purge the school of all Muggle-born students.</p>
