            - A negative impression of Dolores

        <br>
        <p class="text">
            <b>Madam Dolores Jane Umbridge</b> was a half-blood witch and a British Ministry of Magic bureaucrat who served as <i>Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic</i> under Ministers <i>Cornelius Fudge, Rufus Scrimgeour,</i> and <i>Pius Thicknesse</i>. <br><br>
            
            In 1995 by order of the Ministry, she was installed as the <i>Defence Against the Art Professor</i> at <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> and then the <i>Hogwarts High Inquisitor and Headmistress</i> of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, after Professor Albus Dumbledore has been fired. In all three of these positions at Hogwarts she had enormous power over the students, teachers, and the curriculum, which she wielded despotically. Her time at Hogwarts was characterised by cruelty and abusive punishments against students and because of her interfering and condescending ways, she was widely despised by most students and teachers alike. After her suspension from these additional posts and the fall of the Ministry of Magic, Umbridge ran the <i>Muggle-Born Registration Commission</i> and sadistically prosecuted many innocent people. After the Second Wizarding War, she was sentenced to Azkaban for her crimes against Muggle-borns, where she would remain for the rest of her life.<br><br>

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Dolores Umbridge was the first child of a wizard named Orford Umbridge and a Muggle named Ellen Cracknell. Her younger brother was a Squib, but Dolores was born a witch. Under her father's influence, she despised her Muggle mother and her Squib brother, considering them inferior to her and her father, and Dolores and her father denounced them. Before Dolores reached 15 years old, Ellen and her son returned to the Muggle world, never to be heard of again. At some point obtained her wand, made from birch and dragon heartstring with an unusually short length of only eight inches. According to <i>Garrick Ollivander</i>, abnormally short wands usually selected those whose moral character was stunded, rather than because they were physically short.<br><br>
            
            On turning eleven, Umbridge started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was sorted into <a href="Slytherin.html">Slytherin</a> and her head of house was <i>Horace Slughorn</i>. She did not have a good relationship with Slughorn, who considered her to be an "idiotic woman" and that he "never liked her". She was also never given any position of power (i.e. Prefect, Head Girl) during her studies, which made her feel deprived, and she never truly enjoyed her time as a student Hogwarts. <br><br>

        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Dolores Umbridge was an evil woman, who represented the very worst of political power. She was extremely ruthless, cruel, callous, brutal, corrupt, sadistic, arrogant, intolerent, power-hungry and devoid of any kind of moral or ethical centre. She was apathetic and absolulist, yet also a committed and flexible witch who was dogmatically supportive of the British Ministry of Magic, eagarly obeying the every command of Cornelius Fudge, Rufus Scrimgeour and Pius Thicknesse when in their respective terms of power, in order to gain power herself. She was even willing to go to Hogwarts for Fudge, in spite of her bad memories there and strong dislike of children. She was depicted using any means to maintain the political power of her bosses, often flaunting the power she in turn obtained during her time in Hogwarts. She committed attempted soul-removal (via the Dementor attack on Harry), solicited bribes, and tortured children to achieve her goals. Her draconian ideals of discipline, such as having victims write lines in their own blood using a Black Quill, which carves the words into the back of the writer's hand, were considered by Harry and Ron to be "sick". Although Umbridge saw such deeds as doing what was necessary, they ultimately amounted to a form of "the ends justify the means". <br><br>
            
            Her fanatical loyalty clouded her judgement and caused her to place a blind faith in authority, believing that it could not possibly be wrong, and even after it was proven wrong she did not change her opinion, as was clearly seen when she was loyal to Fudge over Dumbledore, rather than accepting the truth, and then abandoning Fudge when he was outset from his office. Umbridge's strictness bordered on the ideal representation of the qualities of a totalitarian government. From her prespective, free speech, dissent, diversity and multiple points of view could not be tolerated. She led not by consensus and respect, but rather by fear and intimidation. Umbridge was capable and intelligent, as she was high-ranking in the Ministry at a relatively young age, although her general magical knowledge seemed limited. <br><br>
            
            For unknown reasons, but mostly likely because of the Ministry's beliefs, Umbridge was fanatically prejudiced against part-humans (such as werewolves and half-giants), which she called "half-breeds". It was her prejudice that caused her to pass a series of anti-werewolf legislature, which made it almost illegal for those afflicted with lycanthropy to hold jobs. Umbridge was a <i>pure-blood supremacist</i>, stemming from her childhood when her brother was discovered to be a Squib. Hating her mother for being a Muggle, Dolores would blame her for being the cause of her brother's lack of magical powers. After bribing her father to quietly leave public sight, Dolores lied to everyone that she was a pure-blood, believing it would give her social respect and status, later bolstering her credentials by falsely claiming that she was related to the Selwyn family. Her lust for power and social status turned her against her own family, though it is unknown how they treated her. <br><br>
            
            Umbridge was known to rapidly resort to cruel and unusual punishments over perceived slights and take great pleasure in such punishments. She showed a particular hatred for Harry Potter, as she had no qualms about violently punishing Harry during detentions (though it is possible Fudge told her to be harsh on him). Despite (or perhaps because of) her feigned politeness, the other teachers found her extremely infuriating and obnoxious. Umbridge because more openly authoritative and cruel as she gained influence over the school, especially during her time as the High Inquisitor, as seen when she interrupted teachers with her leading questions, passive-aggressive comments, and disruptive note taking. There were several signs indicating that Umbridge was impatient and had a short temper. Umbridge often made hypocritical statements, claiming during the Start-of-Term Feast that assured the students that they would all be very good friends, she admitted later that she actually hated children, showing she had sacrificed a lot to do Fudge's bidding.

                <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
                Dolores Umbridge did everything in her power to make Harry Potter's life as miserable as possible, and thus, the two of them had a mutual loathing for each other. With Dolores Umbridge as his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Harry found himslef hating Umbridge the moment he set his eyes on her, from her fluffy pink cardigan to her high-pitched girlish voice, despite not having an actual reason at the time. Umbridge monitored all incoming and outgoing mail, and Harry's owl Hedwig was injured on Umbridge's orders. She made it difficult for Harry, Ron and Hermione to visit Hagrid. Given Harry's grudge against her, it is likely that he provided testimony against her trial before being given a life sentence in Azkaban.

                <b>Cornelius Fudge</b><br>
                Umbridge was Cornelius Fudge's right-hand woman, being his Senior-Undersecretary, and he trusted her greatly to place her into Hogwarts to control it. He granted her many powers through Educational Degrees, and full-heartedly agreed with all of her comments and mockeries against Dumbledore and Harry. Fudge seemed to be unaware of Umbridge's dark and sadistic nature. In return, Umbridge was loyal to Fudge only because of the power he was offering her, and felt no true attachments to the misguided man. When Fudge was dismissed, Umbridge stood beside the new Ministers instead, even when it became apparent that the new regime established in 1997 was morally corrupt (which actually fell in line with her personality).

                <b>Minerva McGonagall</b>
                Minerva McGonagall disliked Dolores Umbridge from the beginning, and their relationship only worsened over time. When the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher began to invade Hogwarts with her Hogwarts High Inquisitor position, she did everything she could in her power to circumvent Umbridge's authority without risking the loss of her job. Although Dolores had the authority to put Minerva on probation or even sack her, Minerva was not afraid to show her disgust and hatred of Dolores to her face. Even when Dolores took over Hogwarts, replacing Albus Dumbledore as head of the school, Minerva continued to help undermine Umbridge's reign, preferring to watch her struggle with the chaos that was being caused by the students and Peeves (sometimes she even helped with it).

                <b>Inquisitorial Squad</b>
                Some of the Slytherin students as well as the caretaker, Argus Flich, happily supported Umbridge during her reign as the High Inquisitor and later Headmistress of Hogwarts; relating her cruelty and sadism with their own ambitions. In fact, Flich claimed that Umbridge was the best thing to happen to Hogwarts, falling for her ploy to gain his trust by rewarding him with, for example, permission to use torture as a form of punishment.
