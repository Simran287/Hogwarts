        <p class="text">
            <b>Severus Snape</b> was an English half-blood wizard serving as <i>Potions Master</i> (1981-1996), <i>Head of Slytherin House</i> (1981-1997), <i>Defense Against the Dark Arts professor</i> (1996-1997), and <i>Headmaster</i> (1997-1998) of the <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> as well as a member of the <b>Order of the Phoenix</b> and a <b>Death Eater</b>. His double life played an extremely important role in both of the Wizarding Wars against <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Voldemort</a>. The only child of Muggle Tobias Snape and Gobstones witch Ellen Prince, Severus was raised in the Muggle dwelling of <i>Spinner's End</i>, which was in close proximity to the home of the Evans family, though in a poorer area. He met <b>Lily</b> and Petunia Evans when he was nine and fell deeply in love with Lily, becoming a close friend of hers.<br><br>
            
            Severus started at Hogwarts with Lily in 1971, where he was Sorted into <a href="Slytherin.html">Slytherin House</a>. This put him in the same year as Lily but unfortunately for him in rival houses. Severus became the immediate enemy of <b>James Potter</b> and <b>Sirius Black</b> was a frequent victim of their bullying. This led him to be irritable towards James' son Harry when he was a professor. Snape became involved with the bullies in <a href="Slytherin.html">Slytherin House</a>, many of whom were <i>pure-blood supramacists</i>. This put his friendship with Lily, a Muggle-born, under great strain until it was eventually broken in their fifth year. In an attempt to win back Lily's affections, Snape joined the Death Eaters along with a group of his fellow Slytherins. Severus was a made a member of the Slug Club presumably because of his talent in Potion-making and <b>Horace Slughorn</b> kept a picture of him as a student, clutching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Despite this, Horace did not have many hopes for Severus' future, as his photograph was kept behind many others.<br><br>
            
            Shortly before Lily Evans was murdered by <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a>, Snape changed sides and became a member of the <b>Order of the Phoenix</b> as well as a double agent during the Second Wizarding War. With tremendous difficulty, Snape prevented Lord Voldemort form learning the truth about his loyalities. Despite the opinions of most others including <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry</a> during his early life, <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Albus Dumbledore</a> trusted Snape for reasons that were kept between them both until their deaths. Despite Snape killing Dumbledore, it is learned that they had a special agreement for him to do so. When he died, it was revealed that his deep strong love for Lily Evans caused him to redeem himself, joining Dumbledore's cause for her protection (and, after her death, that of her son) from Lord Voldemort. <br><br>
            
            The relationship between Dumbledore and Snape would be one of an unusually strong loyalty, so much so that Snape agreed to kill Dumbledore upon the latter's own request. Before Dumbledore's death, Snape promised to protect the students of Hogwarts from the Death Eaters, who would inevitably take control of the <i>Ministry of Magic</i> as well as the school. Snape later participated in the Battle of Hogwarts but was murdered by Lord Voldemort who mistakenly believed that Snape was the master of the <b>Elder Wand</b> (and immensely strong and powerful wand that Voldemort deeply desired, as well as one of the <b>Deathly Hallows</b>) when in reality, Harry Potter was the master of the Elder Wand, because <a href="Draco_Malfoy.html">Draco Malfoy</a> had disarmed Dumbledore on the night of Dumbledore's death on top of the Astronomy Tower, and Harry had disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor. <br><br>
            
            After Snape's death, <a href="Harry_Potter.html">Harry Potter</a> ensured that his portrait remained at Hogwarts, honouring him as a hero, despite their significant personal differences. In addition, Harry later named his second son, <b>Albus Severus Potter</b> in honour of <a href="Albus_Dumbledore.html">Dumbledore</a> and Severus, both of whom were an inspiration in Harry's life after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry also was influenced by Severus' Hogwarts house, and freely admitted that his son Albus could choose <a href="Slytherin.html">Slytherin</a> if he wished.

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Severus Snape was born 9 January, 1960 to <i>Eileen Prince</i>, a pure-blood witch, and Tobias Snape, a Muggle, making him a half-blood wizard. Severus, whose father was neglectful and possibly even violent, bean to identify with his mother's family and created a secret nickname from his mother's maiden name, calling himself the "Half-Blood Prince". His unhappy relationship with his father may have been the origin for his disdain for Muggles. <i>Lily Evans</i> and her family lived in the same town as him. After watching her for some time, Severus noticed her evident magical abilities and began making friendly overtures. The two bonded quickly and it appears that he was very interested in Lily right from the beginning, though she only regarded him as a good friend. During this time he also developed a contempt towards her older sister, <i>Petunia</i>. This was most likely because she made disparaging comments abot his clothes and residence but may also be because she was a Muggle. Information from Severus's own memories of his first interactions with Lily and Petunia suggests that he was an awkward child with poor social skills. Even when it was important to him to make a good impression, he always seemed to have trouble doing so. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            A complicated, withdrawn person, Severus Snape's life was overwhelmed with many complex emotions that he never fully disclosed. At times, Snape could appear cold, cynical, malicious, bitter, and sarcastic. He had a commanding presence that exuded gravitas, authority and control; like <a href="Minerva_McGonagall.html">Professor McGonagall</a>, he had the ability to keep a class quiet without effort. He tended to hold grufges and was extremely spiteful towards those whom he disliked. In particular, he disdained <a href="Gryffindor.html">Gryffindor</a> students, considering them to be arrogant and attention-seeking. Descriptions of his social interactions as a child suggest that he had poor interpersonal skills and that he may have suffered from despression. <br><br>
            
            Snape was a repressed, solitary man with no friends. In his early life, he was insecure, vulnerable, and yearned to be a part of something better. This urgent desire to be a part of something powerful and important was what drew him to <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a>'s inner circle. Snape's bitterness and resentment towards the world was exacerbated even more by the relentless bullying he endured in school, causing him to shut himself in even more. He was an insanely private individual who viewed emotional displays as a sign of shameful weakness. As an <i>Occlumens</i>, Snape had superb emotional control and was adept at concealing his thoughts and feelings, which allowed him to maintain his cold, collected demeanour. <br><br>
            
            Snape was a formidable sorcerer, displaying consummate skill in many different branches of magic. His extensive knowledge and abilities were rivalled by very few, if any other witches and wizards of his age. Snape was also unusually cerebral for a wizard, possessing a subtle and keenly analytical mind. As a result, Snape was extremely intelligent and calculative, with a mind for strategy and deduction. He was also a profound misanthrope who appeared to have a prominent hatred of almost every child under his tutelage, except of course for <a href="Slytherin.html">Slytherins</a>. He valued logic and cunning above magical power. <br><br>
            
            Ultimately, it was Snape's past and his love for Lily Evans that defined his inner being. His love for Lily Evans became most noticeable by his Patronus; a Doe, just like Lily's. Upon overhearing <i>the Prophecy</i>, he immediately informed his then-master of its contents, unaware that this would endanger Lily and her family. It was only after Lily's death that Snape realised the full extent of his actions. He suffered terrible remorse for what he had done and spent the rest of his life in constant danger in order to protect Lily's son. In spite of his vindictive demeanour, Severus Snape was an immensely brave man who possessed a deep capacity for <i>love</i>. Everything that he did in the latter part of his life was motivated by his devotion to Lily Evans, whom he loved unconditionally. He was one of Dumbledore's most reliable allies and in his role as a doble agent, took great personal risk in ensuring Harry's safety from Lord Voldemort. Despite his years of him and Harry barely getting along, if at all, Snape openely critised Dumbledore after learning he protected Harry all these years just so he could die at the right time due to being a Hocrux, showning he didn't agree with Harry's death even though, at first, he only protected him because of his relationship to Lily. When he informed Dumbledore that he informed Voldemort of the prophecy, Snape begged Dumbledore to hide Harry, Lily, and even James too. This clearly showed that Snape prioritised Lily's happiness above all else, even if it meant her being with a man he hated for most of his life.

                <b>Parents</b><br>
                Snape never regarded the place where he grew up as a home. Rather, like Voldemort and Harry, Hogwarts was his real home. It is likely that he suffered neglect as a child. His parents seem to have had a dysfunctional, even abusive relationship. This troubled, lonely childhood is strongly suggested to have accounted for his severe demeanour, depression, sadness, bitterness, and bouts of rage as seen later in his life.

                <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
                <b>Lily Evans</b><br>
                Snape's friendship with Lily Evans was probably the only thing that truly brought joy to his life. He first met Lily at a very young age, recognising her as a witch one day as she and her sister Petunia played in the park near his house; she had flown off the swings and made a flower grow from a sprout. Longing to escape his humiliating home life, Snape immediately sought to make her his friend. In 1971, the two of them were accepted into <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> and continued a close friendship up until their fifth year, despite being Sorted into different houses, Snape was very dissapointed that they were not in the same house and forlorn because of it. During this time, Snape began hanging out with people who embraced Dark Magic and <i>pure-blood supremacy</i>, which put a huge strain on their friendship. When Snape called Lily a <b>"Mudblood"</b> in a moment of humiliation, it was the last straw for Lily. When she later asked him if he still intended to become a <i>Death Eater</i> and he did not deny it, she severed all ties with him, despite Snape's profuse apologies. When Snape overheard the Prophecy, he immediately relayed its contents to the <b>Dark Lord</b>, not knowing that it would have anything to do with Lily. Upon discovering that Lord Voldemort was planning on targeting the Potter family, Snape pleaded with him to spare Lily in exchange for her husband and son. He later appealed to Albus Dumbledore, asking him to do everything in his power to protect Lily and the rest of her family, if he had to. Snape was devastated by Lily's death, to the point of sinking into a depression that seemingly lasted the rest of his life. However, at Dumbledore's behest, he became committed to protecting her son Harry and assisting him in defeating the Dark Lord. As a result of Snape's sacrifice of his own life, Lily's son Harry would name her second grandson after Snape. Coincidentally, said grandson would inherit Lily's green eyes.

                <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
                From the day Harry set foot in Hogwarts, he and Snape loathed each other. Despite the fact that Snape was committed to honouring Lily's sacrifice, he could not bring himself to judge the boy objectively because of his connection to James Potter, who bullied him in his school days. Indeed, Snape was filled with nothing but contempt and bitterness towards Harry, who simultaneously reminded him of both Lily and James. Harry served as living proof of the fact that Lily had given her love to someone else, and Snape wasted no time in comparing him continually with his father. As he lay dying, Snape told Harry to look at him and died looking into Lily's eyes. Following this, Harry was given access to all of Snape's concealed memories, which brought the former teacher's true intentions and more human side to light. When Harry discovered the love Snape had for his mother and the constant danger he put himself in to ensure his safety, he forgave him despite Snape's often cruel treatment of him. By adulthood, all of Harry's hatred of Snape seemed to have vanished and it looked as though he had never harboured it at all. This could be seen through his request that a portrait of Snape be hung in the Headmaster's office at Hogwarts, which was not done immediately after Snape's death since he had abandoned his post. Furthermore, Harry gave his youngest son the name <b>"Albus Severus"</b>, and told him that his Slytherin namesake was <i>"the bravest man I ever knew."</i>

                <b>Albus Dumbledore</b><br>
                Snape's relationship with Dumbledore was one of close, but not indefinite trust. Dumbledore was Snape's headmaster whilst at Hogwarts and was presumably impressed with Snape's academia and abilities. Snape likely felt no real loyalty to Dumbledore as a student and may have resented the latter's failure for stopping the torturous bullying Snape received at the hands of the Marauders. Despite this, he agreed to keep Remus Lupin's lycanthropy a secret when the headmaster ordered him (though likely out of self-serving reasons). Before allying himself with Snape, Dumbledore viewed him with, in his own words, disgust, for the latter's selfishness. In spite of their mutual trust in each other, Dumbledore never allowed Snape his coveted position as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. It was claimed that he did it so that Snape wouldn't experience a resurgence of "old habits". The truth may in fact be that Dumbledore believed the post to be jinxed by Lord Voldemort after he failed to attain the post, and this jinx had prevented any teacher from lasting beyond a year. To place Snape in such a position might have risked his safety, and Dumbledore would not have permitted such a risk, in case he required Snape's aid against Voldemort again. When Dumbledore was infected by the curse on Marvolo Gaunt's ring, he asked Snape to kill him. Knowing that such an act would vilify Snape beyond any doubt in the mind of the Wizarding public, Dumbledore allowed Snape the position because he would have to leave immediately anyway.

                <b>Lord Voldemort</b><br>
                In his days as a Death Eater, Snape was one of Lord Voldemort's most trusted and devoted servants. In 1980, Snape overheard part of a prophecy foretelling Voldemort's downfall. After being caught, Snape hurried to tell Voldemort what he had heard, unaware that his information was incomplete. However, he turned against the Dark Lord the moment he decided to target Lily Potter. It is possible that part of the reason Voldemort put so much trust in Snape was because he identified with his background. However, there were other differences between Snape and Voldemort. Snape had a secret love for Lily Evans for most of his life, which motivated him to defect from the Death Eaters and protect her son after her death at Voldemort's hands. Voldemort, on the other hand, disregarded love as a weakness that was beyond his comprehension, and had allegiance to only himself. This had coincidentally led to his own undoing. In addition, unlike Voldemort, Snape had known about the existence of the wizarding world before he was eleven years old (likely due to the fact that Snape's mother was actually present in his childhood).
                Snape possessed the ability of independent flight, which was presumably taught to him by Lord Voldemort as he displayed the same ability during the Battle of the Seven Potters. This shows that Lord Voldemort had a great deal of trust in Snape as he taught him a very unique ability, something he might not have done with any other Death Eater.
