            <b>Professor Pomona Sprout</b> was a witch who worked as <i>Head of <a href=Hufflepuff.html>Hufflepuff House</a></i> and <i>Head of the Herbology</i> department at <a href="Hogwarts.html">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. She attended the school in her youth, where she was sorted into Hufflepuff and excelled at Herbology. Some time after her graduation, Sprout returned to Hogwarts to teach. <br><br>
            
            Professor Sprout opposed <a href="Lord_Voldemort.html">Lord Voldemort</a> during the Second Wizarding War. In 1993, she grew the Mandrakes that would later be used in the <i>Mandrake Restorative Draught</i> to cure those who were petrified by <i>Slytherin's Monster</i>. She also opposed <a href="Dolores_Umbridge.html">Dolores Umbridge</a> and her tyranny over the school in the 1995-1996 school year, which the rest of the staff were happy to join her in doing, voted for the school to remain open after the <i>Battle of the Astronomy Tower</i>, and assisted in ousting <a href="Severus_Snape.html">Severus Snape</a> in 1998. Sprout took a group of students to the battlements during the <i>Battle of Hogwarts</i> and threw Devil's Snare and various other dangerous plants onto the invading Death Eaters. She ultimately survived the War. By the early 21st century, <a href="Neville_Longbottom.html">Neville Longbottom</a> taught Herbology, alongside her.<br><br>

        <h3 class="heading">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Pomona Sprout was born into a wizarding family of unknown degree on 15 May in Britain or Ireland. She was sorted into <a href="Hufflepuff.html">Hufflepuff House</a> upon her arrival at Hogwarts and excelled at Herbology, which may have been taught by <i>Professor Herbert Beery</i> at the time, and likely achieved a high-graded O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. in the subject.<br><br>
            
            Pomona and <a href="Minerva_McGonagall.html">Minerva McGonagall</a>'s student time at Hogwarts overlapped by two years. The two students enjoyed an excellent relationship both then and in later years. She felt homesick until her friend Minerva helped her getting used to the school. They also helped each other learning the subjects they eventually taught. During her time at Hogwarts, she liked attending Quidditch matches.<br><br>
            
            At some point after her graduation, Sprout returned to Hogwarts as a member of the Herbology department. She taught her classes in the greenhouses at the back of the castle and used one of the greenhouses as office. At an unknown time, Professor Sprout became Head of Department and Head of Hufflepuff House. Professor Sprout used to bring the most interesting specimens (some of which could dance and talk) from the Herbology greenhouses to decorate Hufflepuff Basement. This was one of the reasons why Hufflepuffs were often very good in her subject.

        <h3 class="heading">Personality and Traits</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Professor Sprout was noted to be very cheerful, positive and loyal, but was also very professional and just and would chide her students if necessary. Thus, Sprout possessed all of the virtues and aspects belonging to Hufflepuff House. She was kind and nurturing to the students, and surely encouraged <a href="Neville_Longbottom.html">Neville Longbottom</a>'s penchant for Herbology because he was anxious to show her his <i>Mimbulus mimbletonia</i>. Sprout was also the most maternal of all the Heads of House, an example being when she calmed and got all of the students back to bed after the <i>Battle of the Astronomy Tower</i>.<br><br>
            
            She also seemed horrified when she learnt that <a href="Ginny_Weasley.html">Ginny Weasley</a> had been kidnapped by <i>Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk</i> and taken into the <i>Chamber of Secrets</i>, clasping her shaking hand over her mouth in shock. Professor Sprout was also very brave, always ready to fight for her side. During the Battle of Hogwarts, she did not question McGonagall's decision to defend Hogwarts and immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could, collecting various dangerous plants to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters, showing her utmost loyalty and dedication for defending her school and standing up for what is right.

                <b>Minerva McGonagall</b><br>
                The relationship between Professor McGonagall and Professor Sprout dates back to when both attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The two students maintained an excellent relationship, which was kept well into their adulthood. When Dolores Umbridge stood to speak during 1995 Welcoming Feast after her introduction by Headmaster Dumbledore, the two professors were both taken aback at this, and even exchange glances of disapproval. Furthermore, during the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, Pomona was shown to have similar traits and the same views on protecting the Castle against Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters.

                <b>Neville Longbottom</b><br>
                Pomona was always friendly with Neville Longbottom; she was quite impressed with his skill in Herbology. According to Alastor Moody (Death Eater Bartemius Crouch Jnr in disguise), Sprout told him that Neville had a natural skill for Herbology. In return, Neville always respected Sprout as one of the favourite teachers. In 1995, Neville became excited in the prospect of showing her his Mimbulus mimbletonia. Neville helped Sprout to use Devil's Snare, Mandrakes, Venomous Tentacula, and Snargaluff pods to attack the Death Eaters in the last battle. Neville eventually succeeded Professor Sprout as the Herbology teacher or taught alongside her.

                <b>Cedric Diggory</b><br>
                Because Cedric Diggory was a Hufflepuff student, Professor Sprout knew him well. When Harry Potter became the second Hogwarts champion in 1994, he felt that she had became distant with him as she was supporting Cedric. After Cedric Diggory was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Lord Voldemort's orders, she spoke to his parents, as she knew him best. It can also be assumed that during his memorial feast she felt a sense of tragedy in regards to his loss.

                <b>Harry Potter</b><br>
                Pomona was usually kind to Harry Potter (as well as to his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley). During the Triwizard Tournament, however, Sprout became somewhat distant towards Harry as she thought he was stealing Cedric Diggory's protagonism as Hogwarts Champion. After Diggory's death, Sprout became friendlier to Harry once again.
